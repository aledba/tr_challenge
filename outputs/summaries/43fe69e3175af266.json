  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment against a former employee of a Connecticut religious school for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Windsor, Connecticut, alleges that, on April 19, 2011, a former female employee filed a complaint with the Connecticut Department of Human Resources alleging that the plaintiff had terminated her employment on the basis of her sex, marital status and pregnancy, in violation of state and federal employment discrimination laws. According to the complaint, the complaint alleged that, prior to the enactment of \u00a7'52-571b (d), federal law had provided for the granting or curtailment of statutory or common-law immunity from employment discrimination actions. The complaint further alleged that the federal government had previously granted the same exemption to religious institutions under the ministerial exception to employment discrimination, and that, as a result of that exemption, the plaintiff was entitled to appeal from an agency decision to the Superior Court.  In its judgment, the court held that, in the absence of a federal court jurisdiction, the defendants had no right of appeal to the court.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 5b-5 and 5a-11 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 565 (a) and (c).  The Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about Investor Alerts that encourage investors not to overburden their religious institutions with investments.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Secretary of State's Office and the Connecticut Attorney General's Office in this matter."
