  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Joshua Babineaux, Jr., who was convicted of second degree cruelty to juveniles.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, from January 2015 to January 2016, Babineau, then a resident of Lourdes, New Jersey, engaged in a long-running relationship with a pediatrician who provided medical services to children with second-degree burns.  The complaint alleges that from approximately January 2015 through January 2015, J.R. was in the bathtub with her mother when she was attacked by her brother.  As alleged in the complaint, J&R. had severe burns on her feet and lower back, and she had difficulty standing up and walking.  J&r. continued to urinate on herself, and when confronted by her mother, she replied, \"I'm just being spoiled, but she was afraid of me.\"  The SEC alleges that, based on the evidence presented to the court, that defendant intentionally placed J&rs. R. in the hot water to create the appearance of a burn.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that when confronted about the severity of the burns, defendant allegedly told her that he \"ran this bath water the same way I thought I ran that bath water\" and that he put his penis in her mouth and \"down there,\" i.e. in her vagina.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On February 5, 2019, the SEC filed an emergency action against Babineault, charging him with violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and ordering him to return to the United States to be sentenced to five years of hard labor.  He agreed to be enjoined from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the securities of any public company.  To settle the SEC case, the defendant agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations, and to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.   The settlement is pending final approval by the court. "
