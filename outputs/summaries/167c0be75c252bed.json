  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a Decatur, Illinois man who was arrested for his role in a recent drug-related arrest.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, on October 30, 2017, a car stopped by two Chicago officers for a routine routine check-and-seizure. The complaint alleges that the officers observed a small plastic bag lying on the floorboard of a parked car. According to the complaint, the officers asked the defendant for some identification and, as the defendant opened his wallet, the officer observed the bag. As the complaint alleges, the defendant replied that he did not have any evidence to support a reasonable suspicion of a drug seizure, and the officers did not search the car. The SEC alleges that after the officers entered the car, defendant was confronted by multiple uniformed officers and asked to exit the vehicle.

Sansone of the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued an order suspending the officer-involved sales of any illegal drugs, including marijuana, from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The order also prohibits the officer from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any drug, including, without limitation, possession of a controlled substance, without the reasonable suspicion that a reasonable person would have based on that finding on the evidence presented to the court. The orders also prohibit the officer and the defendant from conducting any search or seizure of any kind other than for the purpose of obtaining a court order prohibiting them from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in a certain class of securities. In addition, the order prohibits the officers from conducting searches or seizures without reasonable suspicion or probable cause, including without the knowledge or consent of the officer or the court of"
