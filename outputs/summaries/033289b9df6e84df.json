  "summary": "On January 18, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin entered a final judgment against the City of Oshkosh, Wis., in a case that was unsealed on Jan. 18.  The court found that the city violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Wisconsin, CED Properties, LLC (\"CED\"), a Wisconsin-based real estate development company, and its owner, James C. Johnson, failed to overcome the presumption of correctness afforded to the city in its earlier special assessment action. The court also found that CED failed to show that the project conferred any \"special benefits\" on CED's property, and that it did not confer any special benefits on the property.  In a parallel action, the court of appeals issued a judgment in favor of CED, finding that the property was entitled to a \"special assessment\" based on the value of the property, without which it would not have been entitled to an offset.  CED also agreed to pay $180,000 just compensation for the taking of its property, which would be offset by compensation owed to the property owner in a subsequent special assessment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the judgment, the city consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins CED from violating the federal, state, and local securities laws, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $40,103.03. The judgment also orders CED to pay disgorgement of $38,850, plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a $10,000 civil penalty for a further $100,000 penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 20, 2017).
