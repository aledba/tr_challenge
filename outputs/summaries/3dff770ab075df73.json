  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment in favor of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Kansas City, Missouri, denying the Church's request for a variance for a digital display on a sign it erected in front of the church building.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Missouri, the Church raised the issue of whether it had the authority to grant a variance to a church without a digital sign.  The complaint alleges that the BZA improperly granted the Church a nonuse variance in 2010 when it requested a variance because the church's digital display was not included in the zoning code and did not meet certain criteria for granting a variance.  In addition, the complaint alleges the Church spent more than $11,000 on the digital display, which was not sufficient to qualify as a \"monument sign\" as required under the federal law.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the church consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil monetary penalty.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rosedale-Skinker of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau and Ms. Skinker. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Department of Commerce, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly and easily identify whether they are registered professionals."
