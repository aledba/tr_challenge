  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against defendant David Berney in a civil injunctive action brought by the Philadelphia Regional Office against Colonial School District.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, Berney and his attorney, David Golembiewski, raised the issue of reasonable hourly rates for services performed before and after the expiration of Colonial's ten-day offer of attorney's fees.  The complaint alleges that Berney agreed to pay a reasonable hourly rate of $385, which represents an increase of 41 percent from the prior year's rate.  Berney also agreed to a five-year bar prohibiting him from charging the same hourly rate as he did on the prior offer.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Philadelphia today announced criminal charges against Berney.  On August 14, 2015, the court granted a temporary restraining order against Colonial from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Berney to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Colonial consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Berney from future violations of Section 1415(i)(3)(D) and Rule 1415 thereunder and orders him to pay $96,787.30 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his fees and to be determined by the court at a later date.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David Hensley of the Philadelphia Office of Advocacy and Public Finance, with assistance from John Rymas of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Philadelphia Police Department, and the Pennsylvania Department of Education. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of overcharging for services that are not performed by professionals in the field of special education."
