  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered a partial judgment in favor of a Covington, Louisiana real estate agent who was charged with fraud in connection with the purchase of undeveloped property.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on September 16, 2016, Wilfred Robinson, III, a resident of Flower Mound, Louisiana, contacted Keller Williams Realty, Inc. (\"Keller Williams\"), a registered agent based in New Orleans, for advice on how to proceed to build a home.  Robinson's complaint alleges that, on December 13, 2013, he and Mighty One entered into a \"Louisiana Residential Agreement to Buy or Sell\" in which the parties agreed to a final, final, and sale price for the lot on which Robinson purchased the lot.  On February 14, 2014, Mighty One sold the lot to Robinson for a total of $242,148.45, a price equal to Robinson's deposit.  The complaint further alleges that Robinson sought a judgment for a refund of his deposit, stipulated damages in the amount of $24,215, representing ten percent of the purchase price, and attorney's fees and costs associated with filing the complaint.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Robinson consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay $9,000.00 in disgorgement plus $1,000 in prejudgment interest, and a $10,000 civil penalty.
