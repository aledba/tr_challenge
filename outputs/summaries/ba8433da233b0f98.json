  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Christopher J. Eppel, a California resident, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, Eppel and Eppel were married in 1992, and they had three children, the youngest of whom was born in May 2000. The complaint alleges that, in 2011, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Eppel from violating the federal securities laws and orders him to pay $117,073.20 in attorney fees. The court also ordered Eppel to pay a civil penalty of $1,284,489.50, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  The complaint further alleges that Eppel consented to the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, and agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal law. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Eppel.  Eppel has agreed to settle the charges by consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations and to a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, other than for his own personal use. The settlements are subject to Court approval.

The Complaint also alleges that the defendants violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Exchange Act for purposes of calculating the value of the securities"
