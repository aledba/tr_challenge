  "summary": "On July 1, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against Wisconsin Central, Ltd., a former freight train company, and its former locomotive engineer, Darrin Riley, in a civil injunctive action.  The court found that the defendants violated the federal securities laws by failing to comply with the company's obligations under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, Wisconsin Central and Riley filed counterclaims in violation of Sections 55 and 60 of the Federal Labor Relations Act of 1940 (\"FELA\").  The complaint alleges that Wisconsin Central failed to exercise ordinary care and acted in an otherwise careless and negligent manner.  As a result of its employees' negligence, the complaint was filed under Section 55 of the FELA, and the complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 55, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1.7 million each.  On July 2, the court issued a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to return their allegedly injured train cars, railroad cars, and railroad track structures to the court-appointed receiver of the injured train.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Chicago Regional Office by John Rymas and supervised by Marc Blau. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Department of Justice, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (FINRA), and the Federal Office of Inspector General (OIGC) in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
