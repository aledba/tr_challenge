  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Gwendolyn Berry, a former bookkeeper at the Davises' home, for her role in a scheme to steal millions of dollars from their retirement accounts.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Houston, alleges that Berry, who lives and works in Phoenix, Arizona, used her position as a bookkeeper to steal approximately $1.8 million from her clients' accounts, including several bank accounts, investment accounts, and section-529-savings accounts. The complaint also alleges that, in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Berry failed to show that she was in a position of trust when, in fact, she was not. Berry has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering her to pay a civil penalty of $1,820,858, and imposing a $1 million civil penalty. Berry also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement, which is subject to court approval, requires Berry to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of the restitution she has already paid. The court also ordered Berry to comply with the SEC\u2019s requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Berry has consented to a permanent injunction prohibiting her from violating these provisions, and to the issuance of a civil injunctive relief. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in this matter."
