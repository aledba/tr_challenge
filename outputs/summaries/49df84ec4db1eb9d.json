  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of a San Jose, California-based company seeking a refund for business property taxes paid on machinery, equipment, fixtures, and other personal property located in San Jose.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Francisco, California, alleges that, from 2003 through 2008, the Santa Clara County assessor improperly issued escape assessments on the property of IBM and other large hard disk drive manufacturers in the same industry as HGST. The complaint alleges that the assessor failed to accurately report the value of the property, and that he or she failed to submit a substantial evidence standard of review to determine whether or not to impose interest.  According to the complaint, the trial court found that the valuation methodology applied to the property did not meet the criteria for imposition of interest under Section 531. The court also found that, contrary to the AAB's findings, the valuation method did not apply to all of the properties at issue.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the company.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar. The defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly and easily identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the U.K. Attorney's office for the Northern District of Florida today announced parallel criminal charges.   The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit in the San Francisco Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Secretary of State's Office, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."
