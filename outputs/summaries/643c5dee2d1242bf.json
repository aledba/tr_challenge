  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a civil action brought by the California Office of the Attorney General.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that on October 17, 2017, the trial court in San Bernardino, California, issued an order granting a temporary restraining order and ordering the parties to bear their own costs of appeal.  According to the complaint, the court found that the defendants were entitled to a lodestar of $57,420, to compensate for 127.6 hours of work performed at a rate of $450 per hour, and a multiplier of two in the amount of $1,075.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay attorney fees on appeal to the court at a later date.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On October 24, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties against the parties.   The court also denied the defendants\u2019 motion for a hearing on October 25, 2017.  As alleged in the SEC\u2019s Complaint, the Court granted the defendants an emergency court order to halt the litigation pending against them, and the parties agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $6,060.96.  Beck also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay an officer and director bar in a separate administrative proceeding.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney for the Northern District of Florida, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the California Secretary of State's Office, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the IRS Criminal Investigations, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and FINRA."
