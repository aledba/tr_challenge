  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on June 12, 2017 entered a final judgment against a former federal employee who was convicted of bribery and conspiracy to commit bribery.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleges that Raushi J. Appellant, while employed in the Department of Commerce, accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments and renovation work from James Bedford, in return for taking official acts to steer government contracts to companies owned by Bedford.  According to the complaint, the delay resulted in the loss of documents essential to a successful data migration project, which required the entire network to be disconnected from the Internet.  As alleged in the SEC\u2019s Complaint, however, that this delay was not a pre-judgment judgment, and that the government did not have final authority to award the contract to Bedford. The complaint further alleges that, in addition to accepting the $55,000 bribe from Bedford and receiving $7,821.75 worth of free labor and supplies to renovate the basement of his home, the complaint alleges that he did so corruptly knowing that Bedford was not part of a bribery conspiracy and did not receive a bribe.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the United States District Court, the SEC has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay a $215,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order suspending the suspension of the former director of operations and systems security at the agency. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of the anti-bribery provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) and the reporting provision of Sections 206(1) and 206(2)-3 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Commission is seeking an order permanently enjoining the former Director of Operations and Systems Security from violating these provisions, and imposing a five-year officer and director bar, as well as an order imposing a $80,000 penalty.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge William J. Donnelly of the United Kingdom granted the SEC request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order against future conduct-related violations of Section 5(b) and (c) thereunder of the federal securities laws, ordering the asset freeze to be permanently enjoined from future violations, and ordering the appointment of a receiver"
