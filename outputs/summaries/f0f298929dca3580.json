  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment finding that a New York City woman with severe back pain was not disabled.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the Administrative Office of the United States Postal Inspection Service (A.O.P.E.S.) issued a final decision on July 4, 2017, finding that the SEC's denial of Social Security benefits violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the Commission's decision was based on a \"lack of supporting medical evidence\" and \"simply not qualified to interpret medical data in functional terms.\"  The Commission's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, reserves the issue of whether to impose a permanent injunction, impose a conduct-based injunction, and require the Commission to conduct a hearing on the matter.  In a related administrative proceeding, the Court issued a temporary restraining order against the Commission from further violating the federal securities laws.  On July 5, 2018, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Manhattan, alleging that the Commission violated Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, and that it was not constitutionally constituted to determine whether a claimant was disabled on the basis of substantial evidence in the record.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commission, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  A hearing for the Commission is scheduled for August 21, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 539 (9th Cir. 1999).
