  "summary": "The Missouri Commission on Human Rights today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order to freeze the assets of a St. Charles, Missouri-based apartment building and its owner.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri, alleges that Linda Vermett, Sally Dickherber, and Scott Henderson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 213.040.1(1) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the SEC's order freezes the assets held by the defendants and orders them to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $2,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions.  In a parallel action, the Missouri Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Appellants for their role in the alleged violations.  On May 24, 2016, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Malam of the Upland Regional Office issued a temporary restraining order, ordering Appellant to pay disgorgement of $5,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalties of $3,000 and $2.5 million, respectively.  Van Den Berk, 26 S.W.3d at 413, and Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office agreed to the final judgment, which permanently freezes the defendants' assets and prohibits them from future violations of the federal securities laws.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Scott J. Birkenheier. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
