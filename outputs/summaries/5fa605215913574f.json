  "summary": "On September 6, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey entered a final judgment against Timber Glen Phase III, LLC, a New Jersey-based real estate development company, and its owner, Christopher C. Cona, in a civil injunctive action.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Jersey, Timber Glen and Cona violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that Timber Glen violated the registration and inspection provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 5(d) of those federal securities laws, and that Cona and O'Hara violated the broker-dealer registration provision in Timber Glen.  Cona also alleges that the fees charged by Timber Glen were unreasonable because they were not related to the municipalities' exercise of their regulatory power.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Timber Glen from future violations of the federal securities law, and orders it to pay a $100 fee and a $50 fee, respectively, for each unit that fails to be registered.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Cona.   The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by David W. Morgan and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the New Jersey Office of Inspector General."
