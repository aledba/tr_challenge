  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho today entered a final judgment in favor of the Phelpses, finding that Boise County violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boise, Idaho on November 16, 2017, charges Boise County with failing to timely respond to a complaint filed by a property owner and his wife, Donna J. Phelps, alleging that the complaint was filed in violation of Section 63-1005 of the Exchange Act.  According to the complaint, Phelps and her husband, Jeffrey R. Hardy, purchased seven lots of property in Mores Creek Heights, a subdivision in Boise County, Idaho, in the early 1980s. The complaint alleges that the property owner was delinquent in paying his property taxes at the time of the tax deed issuance, and the complaint alleged that the County failed to provide timely and reasonable notice of the pending tax deed.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's order, Boise County consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $11,908.79, a $1,000 civil penalty, and a $100,000 penalty.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against Phelps and Hardy.  On November 17, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Boise County for violations of the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and against Jeffrey and Johnna Hardy, for aiding and abetting Boise County\u2019s violations of these provisions.
