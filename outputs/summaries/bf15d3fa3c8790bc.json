  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana today entered final judgments against Universal Health Realty, Inc. (\"Universal Health\"), a real estate development company based in Evansville, Indiana, that was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, Universal Health's property tax liability on the property was computed using the 3% property tax cap.  The court also found that Universal Health failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to have its property tax liabilities computed using that 3% cap because its property was either a hospital, a long-term care property, or an independent living home.  Universal Health also failed to show that the 2% cap applied to just three types of property: residential property, long term care property and agricultural land.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order filed in the case, the company consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Universal Health from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the Indiana Board of Tax Appeals issued a final determination that permanently restrains the Court's order and orders Universal Health to pay civil penalties of $2,500, $100, and $150,000 in disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest, and a $50,000 civil penalty for further determination by the court upon motion of the court.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Illinois, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Indiana Department of Health and Human Services. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
