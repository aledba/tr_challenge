  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana today entered final judgments against Hebron-Vision, Inc. and Vision Communities, Inc., a for-profit real estate development company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, on May 23, 2018, the Indiana Board of Realtors issued a final determination finding that HebronVision failed to qualify for a charitable purposes exemption for the years at issue.  The final determination, which was issued on July 24, 2019, found that, contrary to the Board's finding, Hebron Vision failed to show that it was predominately owned, occupied, and used for charitable purposes.  In addition, the final determination found that the property was not \"purportedly comparable\" to those of other properties at issue, and that it did not provide for the purpose of providing affordable housing to low-income individuals and families.  Additionally, the court ruled that the valuation of the property, which is subject to court approval, is inconsistent with the charitable purposes provisions of the federal tax laws.  For example, the Court found that HebronsVision failed not to show it provided affordable, safe, and sanitary rental housing to its tenants, despite the fact that it received no government funding to provide such housing.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the final judgment, the Board also ruled that, based on the evidence presented in the complaint, the property should be deemed \"charitable.\"  The court further ruled that it could not determine whether or not to issue a final judgment that permanently enjoins the company from violating the above-mentioned provisions and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and orders the company to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.   The Court's order also prohibits the purchase, sale, or transfer of any real estate located within the jurisdiction of the court, and prohibits the sale, transfer, purchase, alteration, or alteration of any property owned or operated by a member of a recognized charitable organization.  It also orders the purchase and transfer of all real estate in the state of Indiana, including residential and commercial real estate, to be subject to the approval of a court order requiring the purchase of a certain amount of real estate.  Further, the order requires that the company pay a $20,000 penalty and the amount of any civil penalty to be determined by the court at a later date.  On June 21, 2019 the court granted the request for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the anti-fraud provision of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10"
