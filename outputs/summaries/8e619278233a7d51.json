  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against Utah-based manufacturers and distributors of opioid drugs for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that the Utah State Attorney General's Office improperly obtained a court order to transfer an action for discovery and pretrial purposes from the second district court to the third district court.  According to the complaint, the court granted the motion in part, consolidating all of the pending cases in the state in the third and fourth district courts.  In its judgment, the Court found that the venue transfer statute was not sufficient for pretrial proceedings and that the court had the inherent power to transfer the case.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's judgment, Davis County consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court at a later date.  Davis County also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public district court for five years.  On May 2, 2019, the Utah Court of Appeals issued its final judgment in favor of Davis County, ordering the transfer of the case to the court in which the first related action was filed.   The final judgment also prohibits Davis County from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any order or order, and bars it from acting as a broker or dealer in any securities offering or offering to sell or offer to sell any security in the securities of any brokerage firm, municipal securities dealer, municipal bond dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  It also orders Davis County to comply with the court\u2019s order to disgorge its allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interests and pay civil penalties of $15,000 and $1,500, respectively, in the form of a civil injunctive relief order.  Additionally, the order requires Davis County and the other defendants to show cause and effect before the court that they have the authority to transfer a case from one district to another for the purpose of obtaining a court-ordered injunction against future violations of the securities laws.  For further information, see Salt Lake County v. Rettig, 2014 UT 83, (1906).  The court also granted the request for a temporary restraining order against Davis County"
