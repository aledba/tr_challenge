  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment against Progressive Insurance Company, Inc., a New Mexico-based insurance company, and its owner, Martin Vigil, in a civil injunctive action brought by the Vigils.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on September 21, 2011, the court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint further alleges that the court improperly excluded evidence of the defendants' payment of $200,000 to settle third-party claims.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants failed to show sufficient evidence to show that they acted in bad faith by refusing to pay the settlement payments.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New Mexico announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On September 27, 2011 the court granted the defendants a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their disgorgement plus interest, and to pay civil penalties in a parallel criminal case.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Progressive consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders the parties to pay a civil monetary penalty of $100,000 each. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and Eric R. Werner of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Mexico Office of Insurance Regulation, and the Arizona Department of Insurance in this matter."
