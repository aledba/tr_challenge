  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against a Florida man who was convicted of a series of unenumerated felony charges.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that Wesley Brown violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Brown was initially arrested as a fifteen-year-old for vehicular homicide; fleeing and eluding; and driving while license canceled, suspended, or revoked causing serious bodily injury or death.  Brown was later charged as an adult for those same charges and was subsequently sentenced to prison without bond.  As alleged, Brown failed to waive his right to be treated as a juvenile and instead \"rolled the dice\" with a jury trial in the adult division and lost.  In a parallel action, the Florida Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Brown arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On May 24, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Central District of New York granted Brown's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against him from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Brown consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, and from participating as an officer or director of a public company in any jurisdiction.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as a public figure for five years and ordered to pay an $80,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer and director bar.  Additionally, Brown agreed to a five-year bar from appearing and practicing before a jury, and agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations of Sections 985.557(1)(a) and (c) 17(a)(1) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The settlement is subject to court approval.
