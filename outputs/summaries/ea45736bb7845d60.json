  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Wisconsin man accused of engaging in child pornography.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Andrew Paul Schmidt, of Fon du Lac, Wis., produced, transported, and possessed child pornography, including images of himself in his uniform and pictures of his medals.  According to the complaint, Schmidt told an undercover FBI agent that he had had a sexual experience with his daughter when she was very young at Disney World and finished on her while she was on the changing table because he couldn\u2019t control himself.  He also allegedly described his desire to meet the girl for sex as \u201ctotally unrealistic.\u201d  The complaint further alleges that Schmidt told the agent that his daughter had been raped by sex tourists and that he would \u201czoom[\u2009] in\u201d on multiple children\u2019s genitalia to take an explicit picture of her.  In addition, the complaint alleges that he sent the child pornography to another individual, who he described as a \u201cpiece of cake\u201d who \u201ctrusted \u2018him\u2019 with her life.\u2019  Schmidt also allegedly shared the child porn with his friend Avalos, who was also a victim of the alleged grooming.  Schmidt agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and agreed to pay a penalty of 360 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by a lifetime of supervised release.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Schmidt consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar, and imposes a 10-year conduct-based injunction against Schmidt from participating in or participating in any future online adult education program.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by the Office of the United States Attorney for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the New York State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
