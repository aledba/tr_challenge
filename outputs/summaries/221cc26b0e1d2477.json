  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Maryland yesterday entered a final judgment against defendant Nicholas Heath for his role in the September 25, 2014, murder of a Baltimore City man and the attempted murder of his friend.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Mr. Heath was charged in September 2014 with the murder of Tom Malenski and Martin Clay, both of whom were also charged with the same crime.  The SEC alleges that, in a parallel action, the trial court entered a temporary restraining order and ordered the SEC to determine whether to proceed with a new trial.  In its order, the SEC also entered a preliminary injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and entered a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court also issued an order suspending the SEC from issuing any orders or orders suspending the defendants from soliciting or selling any illegal drugs, including, without limitation, the issuance of a cease-and-desist letter to the defendants and the entry of an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver.    The court's order also temporarily suspended the investigation that led to the discovery of the criminal case. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Baltimore Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Maryland Office of the Attorney General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Baltimore Office of Financial Regulation."
