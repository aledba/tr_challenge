  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, alleges that Dewayne V. Hambright, who pled guilty to felony criminal damage to property and felony theft for events that took place on September 2, 2014, was improperly ordered to serve a 36-month probation term. The SEC alleges that Hambright violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose substantial and compelling reasons to depart from the presumptive duration of probation for Hambright's felony offense.  According to the complaint, Hambright also failed to disclose to the court that, pursuant to the SEC's order, he was entitled to a mandatory minimum probation term of 24 months.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Hambright.  Hambright has agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, and orders him to pay a $500,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the court agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining Hambright from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and ordering that he pay a civil penalty of $250,000. The court also ordered that he be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit, and from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  On May 25, 2000, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued a temporary restraining order halting the issuance of the restraining order, ordering that the amount of his sentence be determined by the court at a later date, and requiring him to comply with the court's order. The order also requires the court to determine whether to impose a penalty based upon the severity level of the sentence.  For further information, see State v. Schad, 41 Kan. App. 2d 805, 827, 361 P.3d 22 (2009).  The court granted the request for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 15(a)(1) and 15(b)(2)(A) and (c)(3)(B) and ordered that the court determine the appropriate amount of restitution to be paid in a timely manner.  Additionally, the order prohibits the issuance or issuance of any"
