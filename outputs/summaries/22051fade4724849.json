  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Robert M. (father), the noncustodial and nonoffending father of a 12-year-old child who was the subject of six referrals to the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) for placement with father.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, on January 9, 2014, the court found that C.M. and her half sibling, S., were at risk of being removed from their father's home because of a history of domestic violence.  The court also found that, contrary to the court's finding, C.Ms. and S. did not have an established relationship with their father and were not likely to be placed with their respective fathers.  In addition, as alleged in the complaint, the father had threatened suicide and had threatened to move to Tennessee.  As alleged, the complaint further alleges that, in addition to physical harm to the children, mother and father were in denial about the children's well-being because of their attachment to their father, and there was no evidence the father used illicit drugs or drank an inappropriate amount of alcohol at any time after the dependency proceedings commenced.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, which was filed on March 21, 2014 and unsealed on March 24, 2014 in federal district court in Manhattan, the Court granted the request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the release of the children from the custody of the father and mother-in-law.  On March 26, 2014 the court granted the court order for the children to remain with their maternal grandmother, who was not available to make an appearance at the hearing.  After a hearing on March 27, the judge granted the order, and the children were placed with the maternal grandmother.  A hearing was scheduled for April 5, 2015, for which the court approved the motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered that the court determine whether to impose a permanent injunction against any future violations of these provisions, including the issuance of a cease-and-desist order and the appointment of a court-appointed receiver to determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion of the court.   In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against C."
