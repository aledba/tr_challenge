  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Bridgeport man accused of orchestrating a series of mass shootings.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Bridgeport, New York, alleges that Raashon \"Popa\" Anderson, a cousin of one of the victims of the September 10, 2013 Bridgeport mass shooting, provided false testimony to a jury in a parallel criminal case.  According to the complaint, Anderson told the jury that he had prepared maps depicting the location of victims' cell phones and related testimony, which he claimed were relevant to the defendant's theory that Anderson was the shooter. The complaint further alleges that Anderson had been seeking ammunition eight days before the shooting, when he was confronted by two men who shot at him.  Anderson allegedly replied, \"I had seen someone he knew, and that he should park the car and wait for him and Jackson until they returned to the scene of the shooting.\"  The complaint alleges that the jury was not required to determine the relevance of the evidence presented to the jury.  Instead, the court improperly barred Anderson from appearing before the jury as an expert and from introducing any evidence that could be relevant to his or her claim for a Porter hearing.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Anderson consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078.95 plus prejudgment interest of $2,079.95, a civil penalty of $100,000, and a $50,000 officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Connecticut today entered final judgments against Anderson against him, finding him liable for a total of forty-five years imprisonment.  On October 22, 2015, a federal district court in New York entered a temporary restraining order against Anderson and ordered him to surrender his passport. The court granted the court's order and ordered Anderson to comply with the court order, which requires him to show cause and effect, including a copy of the court orders, that he has a right to present a defense under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the federal securities laws. The order also prohibits Anderson from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to a penny stock, without a court-ordered injunction, and prohibits him from providing or receiving any information concerning the subject"
