  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a convicted sex offender for his role in a scheme to manipulate a trial jury.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Steven Force, a convicted felon who is currently receiving treatment at a state mental hospital for pedophilia and exhibitionism, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendant raised the prospect of perjury with a trial judge, telling her that he \"would rather have dirty hands if he had dirty hands.\"  The complaint further alleges that the judge agreed to exclude the defendant from the conditional release program because he \"was not ready to reject it yet.\"  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendant was effectively driven away from the witness stand by the prosecutor, who had kept a written version of the defendant's statement out of evidence.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment against Force that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, Force consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively.  To settle the case, Force agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and ordered to pay disgorgement of $20,000 plus prejudgment interests of $1,038, and a $10,000 civil penalty.  He also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school for five years.  As part of the settlement, Force will be permanently barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as a result of his conduct, and will be prohibited from associating with any third-party attorney or practicing as an attorney.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter."
