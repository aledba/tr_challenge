  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against California resident Joseph Cuviello, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 8.56 of the California Municipal Code.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendants\u2019 assets, and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in federal district court in Vallejo, California on May 9, 2014, the court found that, in violation of the First Amendment, the city had violated the pre-emption provision of the federal securities laws, and that the city was entitled to a preliminary injunction against violations of the preemption provision.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action and obtained an emergency court order halting the city from enforcing the federal law.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the City has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating these provisions, ordering the city to comply with the court order, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty.  Cuviiello has also agreed to pay a $20,000 penalty and to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 17-cv-17, Lit. No. 13-cv 13-14. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Insurance, and the Vallevolino Police Department in this matter.  This matter is being handled by John Rymas and Eric Werner of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit in the Los Angeles Regional Office."
