  "summary": "On December 19, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment against HUD, ordering the agency to suspend or delay implementation of the Housing Choice Voucher (SFFR) rule for 24 metropolitan areas.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago on Dec. 23, 2016, HUD delayed the implementation of SFFR until at least 2020.  The complaint alleges that HUD failed to adequately consider the impact of the delay on low-income tenants' rental housing market conditions.  In its order, the court also ordered HUD to provide an accounting of the number of units available to voucher holders in each of the 24 metro areas subject to the rule.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, HUD has agreed to the entry of a final rule that requires all PHAs to implement SFFRs by at least two years.  On January 1, 2018, HUD announced that it would suspend or exempt a SAFR designation for 24 metro area PHAs in 24 states, including the Dallas, Texas area, for reasons unrelated to the safety and well-being of the voucher holders.

Under the proposed injunction, HUD will have the option of suspending or exempting the SAFR provision from the federal securities laws, or to issue a civil injunctive relief order.
