  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment in favor of Karen L. Brady, a New Orleans, Louisiana couple who filed for a divorce.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans on February 6, 2018, Ms. Brady and her husband, David A. Pirner, entered into an agreement in which they agreed to pay $175,000 to settle a civil action brought by the district court against them. The agreement provided that the couple would retain the fruits and revenues of their separate property when the court found the agreement void and ordered the couple to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their jointly-owned property. The court also found that the agreement was void when it was not executed in compliance with the specific provisions of the agreement.  The SEC alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c).  The complaint also alleges that, in violation of Section 15(a)(1) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1, that the parties entered into a separate property agreement with the understanding that the property would be entitled to be sold by private sale at a later date.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay civil penalties equal to their respective amounts of disgorgement and prejudgment interest. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Pirner.
