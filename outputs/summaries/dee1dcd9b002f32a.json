  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Utah today entered final judgments in favor of Herriman City, Utah residents Leland and Sheri Mascaro, and their company, LJ Mascaros Inc., in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake County, Utah, alleges that the Mascaros violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that they failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their assertion that their use of the property was legal prior to the county's denial of their request for nonconforming use status.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as alleged in the complaint, the Mascars did not provide any definitive evidence that they had ever used the property for topsoil manufacturing and screening, that the county had not granted them a prior legal use, or that the city had not already annexed the property.  Finally, the SEC alleges that in 2013, the Utah Secretary of State's Office issued an order granting summary judgment against herriman city, denying her request for a non-conforming-use status, and ordering her to pay a civil penalty of $25,000.  According to the SEC's order, the defendants failed to show substantial evidence of prior violations of the federal, state, and local laws when they applied for the non-commissioned status, which is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the Defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations, ordering them to pay civil penalties of $20,000 each, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against each of them. The settlements are pending final approval by the court, which will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by a court at a later date. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Department of Commerce, the Salt Lake Regional Office, and the Utah Office of Planning and Zoning Regulation in this matter."
