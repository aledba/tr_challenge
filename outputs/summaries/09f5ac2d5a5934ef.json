  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that, from at least 2014 through 2018, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) unlawfully detained two Guatemalan men and their seven-year-old daughter, Mia.  According to the complaint, Mr. H and Mia, who are married and live in New Jersey, were initially detained by the DHS in August 2019. The complaint alleges that they were released without being questioned or questioned by an immigration judge, and were later released on their own recognizance. The court found that, based on the facts at issue, the two men were not at risk of being removed from the country and were not subject to mandatory detention. Instead, the complaint alleges, they were held in the custody of their mother and her newborn son, who were also in the country illegally. The Court found that the men and woman were at a risk of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered them to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order suspending the detention of both men for a period of five years. The order also prohibits the issuance of a cease-and-desist letter or an order appointing a receiver to oversee the repatriation of the father and daughter of an arriving illegal alien.  On January 6, 2020, the court granted the request for an emergency court order and ordered the release of all three men and women in the family, including Mia, to the Department of Justice's Office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (DICE).  The court also granted the family's motion for an expedited hearing on January 13, 2020.  A hearing scheduled for February 21, 2020 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. EST. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS), the Mexican Attorney General's Office, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1256 (2014)."
