  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Dante Allen, finding him liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Fayette County, Georgia, alleges that on July 20, 2014, a uniform patrol watch commander stopped a car Allen was driving because the right brake light was not functioning. According to the complaint, the officer asked Allen to exit the car and step to the rear of the vehicle. Allen agreed to the officer's request, but the officer allegedly delayed the stop until he detected the odor of marijuana coming from the car. The complaint further alleges that Allen asked for his driver's license and a Georgia identification card, and when the officer inquired whether the driver had a valid license, he gave the officer an expired one. The officer allegedly extended the stop beyond the conclusion of the investigation that warranted the stop, and the officer called the K-9 unit for assistance. The SEC alleges that the officer then called a backup officer to the scene for a free air search of the car, and Allen refused to comply with the request. The court's order against Allen permanently enjoins him from participating in any future solicitation of a jury, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. Allen has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against Allen arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint.  On May 24, 2018, the U. S. District Judge in Atlanta granted Allen's motion for a new trial and ordered him to appear before the court at a hearing scheduled for May 26, 2018. The hearing was scheduled for 6:30 p.m.  Allen consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. The final judgment orders Allen to show cause and effect that he has the right to represent himself at trial, including, without limitation, that he is entitled to a fair trial and that he will not be liable for the imposition of any civil penalty. The order also prohibits Allen from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in securities, and from making or selling any offer to sell any security, including the securities of a publicly-traded company. Allen also agreed not to participate in any solicitation for a jury trial, and agreed to a hearing that would be subject to approval by the court."
