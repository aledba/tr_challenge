  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former Social Security Administration employee who was found not disabled by the agency.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York on March 31, 2014, William A. Bray, a registered representative of the Social Security Agency, was not disabled.  The complaint alleges that the agency improperly assessed the severity and limiting effect of a claimant\u2019s impairment on his ability to perform work related to his disability.  Bray also alleged that, contrary to what the agency claimed, Plaintiff had a history of panic attacks, avoidance of public places, anxiety, and agoraphobia.  In addition, Bray alleged that Plaintiff had severe anxiety, depression, and panic attacks.  As alleged in the complaint, Plaintiff suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that made him unable to function in a work setting, and that he had difficulty maintaining a balance between work and play.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Bray consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221.  This case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Office of Inspector General, and the New Jersey Department of Health and Human Services."
