  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment against Zion Wainwright, a former college student who was convicted of murder and other crimes in connection with the December 2013 shooting death of Xavier Arnold.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that, on December 26, 2013, the trial court erred in denying a requested continuance for his lead counsel to be present for the beginning of the State\u2019s direct examination of a key witness, and that his lead trial counsel was ineffective in cross-examining that witness.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the two men.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed on January 2, 2019, the jury deliberated for nearly an hour before finding Wainwrights guilty of the same charges.  On January 3, 2020, the court granted the SEC a temporary restraining order and ordered the trial to proceed as scheduled.   The complaint alleges that Wainright violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  Additionally, the judgment orders the defendant to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and requires the defendant be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of five years. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling them investments by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  Investors can also check the background of anyone selling investments using the Investor.gov website to find out how many people are registered to invest in an investment.  For example, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
