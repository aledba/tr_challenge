  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Dawn Cottman, a California resident charged with defrauding the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by filing false tax returns with the agency.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Phoenix, Arizona, alleges that on May 7, 2013, federal agents conducted a search warrant on the home of Faisal Hashime, a 19 year old college student living at home with his parents.  According to the complaint, Appellant prepared and filed hundreds of individual income tax returns from her home office, including hundreds of thousands of dollars in fraudulent tax returns that were then sent to her brother and sister-in-law, who were also arrested.  As alleged, the agents entered the home at approximately 9:45 a.m. and demanded to know the identity of the person who filed the tax returns, and that Hashime was not under arrest.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, during the course of the search, one of the agents raised the issue of whether there was any reasonable person in the position of the individual being questioned by the agents.   The complaint further alleges that the agents did not tell the defendant that she was free to leave the house and did not have the right to do so.  Instead, they simply told her that she had to be completely honest with the agents and that she would be able to terminate the search if she wanted to.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. \u00c2\u00a0The final judgments also order the defendants to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits.  Finally, the court granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from using the internet or other means to obtain or sell any information concerning the subject of a court order or order an officer to conduct a search of a person's home.  On May 8, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court in Phoenix against the defendants, ordering them to disgorge their gains with interest, pay civil penalties, and appoint a receiver to oversee the investigation.
