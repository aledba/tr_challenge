  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants' motion for a new trial.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to allow the defendants to question members of the jury during voir dire questioning.  According to the complaint, the defendants also failed to allow counsel to inquire into the potential biases of the thirty-one potential jurors.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants failed to inform the jury that the jury had concluded that the decedent's death was caused by smoking cigarettes, and that the tobacco defendants denied the claim.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants the right to question the jury at any time, including during jury selection, without being asked directly by the jury.  As a result of the court's order granting the new trial, the jury was not able to determine whether the jury should be excused from participating in the jury selection process, and the defendants have agreed to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which will be determined by the court at a later date upon motion by the SEC.  To settle the case, defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions, to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and to be subject to the same conduct-based injunctive relief as the jury in the case.  On the same day, the SEC issued an order suspending jury selection for the rest of the year and ordering the jury to participate in the selection of a jury that will be comprised of men and women.  Among other things, the Court granted the jury's request for a temporary restraining order, barring the defendants from conducting any conduct outside the presence of the jurors, and barring the jury from conducting an examination of prospective jurors. The court also ordered the jury not to question any of the panel members during trial, which is unusual for a trial court.  It also directed the jury members to be individually questioned by counsel for each of them. The jury selection was conducted in a side room, with the exception of one juror who agreed not to be questioned during the selection process."
