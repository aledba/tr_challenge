  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Santa Monica Rent Control Board Chairman J. Stephen Lewis for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Lewis, ordering him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Santa Monica, California, Lewis violated Section 1803 of the Rent Control Law by failing to apply for a Category C removal permit, which exempts rental units from rent control.  Lewis agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Lewis.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Lewis consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, and sale of any rental property that is subject to rent control, including residential units, for which Lewis had previously obtained a removal permit. The judgment also prohibits Lewis from acting as an unregistered broker-dealer or purchasing or selling any rental unit, and prohibits him from issuing or selling a rental property for which he has a right to a fair return. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Birkenfeld and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by John R. Rymas. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."
