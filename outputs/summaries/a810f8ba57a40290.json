  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas on October 25, 2018 entered a final judgment against Maverick County, Texas, and its former County Judge, Judge David Saucedo, for violating the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).  The court found that the defendants violated the FLSA by failing to pay excessive overtime to certain of the Deputies.  According to the court's order, in 2005, the District Court entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants and ordered them to pay over $1 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Texas, alleges that the Defendants violated Rule 615, which requires defendants to show cause and effect in order to comply with their discovery obligations.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2011, the district court imposed a partial class certification for certain Deputies who did not comply with FLSA requirements.  On the second day of trial, the defendants' testimony significantly shifted from their interrogatories and the testimony given on the first day.  As alleged in the complaint, this change in testimony was consistent with the Defendants\u2019 failure to pay overtime to employees and the amount of compensation they would receive.   The complaint further alleges that, in a parallel action, the court agreed to strike the Defendants from the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint.  It also ordered the Defendants to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million, which is equal to the amount owed to the Defendants by the Defendants in the civil injunctive action, and ordered the defendants to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interests, pay civil penalties of $500,000, and pay a $100,000 civil penalty to the Defendant-Appellees.  Finally, the Court agreed to impose a three-year statute of limitations for the Defendants.  Without admitting or denied the allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to comply, and imposing an injunction against further violations of the charged rules.  Maverick also agreed to pay $1,500 in disgorge interest and a $50,000 penalty, and to a $25,000 administrative penalty.  This settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 24, 2019).  In a related case, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the Defendants for their roles in the alleged violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of"
