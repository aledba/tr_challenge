  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was sentenced as a career offender under the federal antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that, in 2003, Brooks Tyrone Chambers pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute 50 or more grams of crack cocaine in violation of Section 3552(c)(2). The complaint alleges that Chambers was eligible for a reduced sentence based on a \"hypothetical enhancement\" that he did not receive for either his 1996 or 1997 conviction for the same drug. The complaint further alleges that he was not entitled to a mandatory life sentence under the First Step Act, because he had been previously convicted of three prior felony drug-related felonies. The SEC alleges that the defendants were not eligible to receive the same sentence as they were when they were sentenced under the Fair Sentencing Act, and that the court did not consider the career-offender error when recalculating the Guidelines range. Instead, the court granted the motion in part, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to a temporary restraining order that temporarily enjoins Chambers from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his sentence.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina today announced criminal charges against Chambers.  According to the SEC's continuing investigation, which is continuing, the SEC is evaluating the merits of the case. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the U.N. Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Justice in this matter."
