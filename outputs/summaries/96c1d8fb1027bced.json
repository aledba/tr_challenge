  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Lawrence Chirlow, who was found competent to stand trial on two felony charges.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on July 1, 2015, the Jefferson Parish District Attorney filed a bill of information charging Defendant with possession of cocaine in excess of 28 to 200 grams, in violation of the federal securities laws, and with intent to distribute marijuana.  According to the complaint, Defendant consented to the issuance of the final judgment without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, which included that he had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the mandatory sentencing provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) of Securities Act of 1933.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Defendant.  On August 2, 2018, the U. S. District Judge in New York entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Defendant from future violations of the securities laws and orders him to pay a $500,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer-and-director bar. The court also ordered that the amount of the civil penalty be determined by the court at a later date by a court-appointed receiver of the case.   The court's order also prohibits Defendant from participating in any self-help or substance-abuse programs offered by the Department of Corrections.  Without admitting to these violations, Defendant has agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions, ordering him to comply with the schedule of fines, fees, sentencing provisions, and probation requirements, and to provide an independent review of the record to determine whether any other time imposed should be imposed on him. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing on August 5, 2018 was scheduled for 11:59 a.m. Eastern Time. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom's Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United State Department of Justice."
