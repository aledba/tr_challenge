  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Scholastic, Inc., an international publisher of children\u2019s books and textbooks.  The court granted the defendants\u2019 request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and other relief.  On January 5, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  According to the SEC, in 2016, Michael Yamashita filed a complaint in federal district court in New Jersey alleging that, in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, that he was entitled to a partial injunction against violating these provisions.  In addition, the court denied the defendants the right to a preliminary injunction, and ordered the defendants to file an amended complaint, which included additional allegations about violations of the anti-fraud provision of Section 12(b)(6) of Exchange Act Rule 12b-20. The court also denied the Defendants\u2019 motion for a partial restraining order and to send a copy of the Complaint to the court for review.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay a civil monetary penalty of $10,000. The defendants also agreed to be barred from serving as officers or directors of any SEC-licensed agency for at least five years.  Additionally, the judgment prohibits them from issuing or selling any security or other security-related documents, and from making any offer to purchase or sell any security-based security. The SEC also prohibits the defendants from associating with any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 6, 2018).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of the United States Attorney for New Jersey."
