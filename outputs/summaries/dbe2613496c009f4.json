  "summary": "On May 25, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against a former trustee for a dairy cooperative that had terminated its membership.  The court granted the trustee's motion for a temporary restraining order and entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the trustee from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.  According to the court's order, filed on August 19, 2016, filed in federal district court in Chicago, Mark S. Trackman and his wife, Laurel S. Michela, filed a third amended complaint in which they alleged that, by 2007, defendant exerted undue influence over Marcella, causing her to deprive him of his inheritance, and by signing the 2007 trust amendment without her knowledge or consent. The court also found that, in the fourth amended complaint, defendant had the right to amend the trust, but he did not have the capacity to do so. In addition, as alleged in the complaint, the defendants had failed to disclose to the trustee that the trust had been terminated and that, as a result of their actions, they had been denied their full inheritances and had suffered emotional injuries.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the first action, the trustee consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 17(a)(1) and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and requiring him to provide a copy of the judgment. The trustee also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receiver. The receiver will determine the receiver's status. The final judgment will be determined by the court at a later date. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter.
