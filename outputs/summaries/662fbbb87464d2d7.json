  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment against a New Haven man who was convicted of a felony for his role in a 2005 New Haven double-murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that, on June 23, 2005, Nadine Crimley and her brother, Ray Caple, were confronted by a third-party witness who claimed to have witnessed Darrell Mayes confessing to the crime. According to the complaint, the witness, who was a high school classmate of Crimley's and Caple's, claimed that he had witnessed Mayes commit the crime and that the witness had been able to spot Mayes on the street. The complaint further alleges that Crimley, Caple and the witness agreed to testify that they had not seen Mayes or Mayes at the time of the murder and that they did not know that Mayes had shot the victim.

Streeto, alleging that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On March 26, 2019, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction against the defendants from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordered the defendants to surrender their guns, and ordered the destruction of any evidence that may have been presented to the court.
