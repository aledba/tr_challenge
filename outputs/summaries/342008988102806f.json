  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi yesterday entered a final judgment against Sherry Ann Campbell Graves Page, a former assistant principal at a Jackson, Mississippi public school, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Miss., alleges that Sherry and Bryan Graves, who are married and live in Clinton, Mississippi, began working with the girls after Bryan and Sherry divorced in 2014.  According to the complaint, the girls were placed in the custodial home of Bryan's mother and sister, Anna and Sarah, and Bryan and Sarah moved to Monroe, Mississippi to live with Sherry.  As alleged, during their time in the home, Sherry was concerned about the children's lack of attention to their needs, and asked Bryan to check on the children before he took them back to their mother's house.  Bryan agreed, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins Sherry from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Bryan, Anna, and Sarah.  On November 15, 2017, the court granted Sherry's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered her to return the girls to her mother and father, who were living in Virginia at the time of the divorce.  Sherry agreed to the order and agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school for five years.  She also agreed to be enjoined from associating with any person with a history of substance abuse or mental illness, including with a criminal defendant, from participating in any form of child-rearing, including through the use of a social media platform, including on social media.   The court also ordered Sherry to give due consideration to the facts of the matter before she could issue a judgment imposing a permanent injunction and ordering her to comply with the court's order. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by David Giannaris of the Atlanta Regional Office and was supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the Division of Child and Adolescent Education and the Office of Advocacy and Advocacy. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Secretary of State's Office, the U.K. Secret Service, and the FBI."
