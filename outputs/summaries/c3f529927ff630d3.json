  "summary": "On July 6, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against Thomas M. Magdic, Jr., a paratransit driver for Veterans Cab Company, ordering him to pay $50,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on March 26, 2015, in Derry Borough, Westmoreland County, Appellant was charged with theft by unlawful taking, receiving stolen property, and firearms not to be carried without a license.  The complaint alleges that, on the date of the alleged theft, he had a loaded Beretta pistol in his jacket pocket, which he draped over the driver's seat of the vehicle he was driving.  As alleged in the complaint, the jury was exposed to the fact that the defendant had previously committed a violent crime prior to deciding counts one through four, and that he had previously been convicted of robbery and aggravated assault.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the SEC, Judge Brown granted the motion for a bifurcated trial on all of the charges.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office today announced that it has obtained a court order freezing the assets of the defendants, imposing a $25,000 civil penalty, and appointing a receiver to determine whether to proceed with prosecution of the remaining charges. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Philadelphia Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit, and Amy C. Welshhans. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Pennsylvania Department of Justice in this matter."
