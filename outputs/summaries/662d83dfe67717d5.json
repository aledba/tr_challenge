  "summary": "On September 12, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi entered a final judgment in favor of the City of Pearl and the heirs of their wife, Bertha Bailey, who were injured while driving to their grandson's baseball game.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, on September 18, 2017, Kenneth Bailey claimed that the city of Pearl had failed to properly design and install a gate at its park, which allowed it to swing partially closed. Bailey also alleged that the gate was left unsecured and unattended when the Baileys left the park. The complaint alleges that this created a substantial, unavoidable, hazardous condition.  The complaint further alleges that Bailey was negligent in failing to properly supervise, hire, and train his employees, and that he caused his wife's death by failing to adequately supervise and hire his employees.  As alleged in the complaint, Bailey's claims were based on policy considerations and were correctly dismissed by the court.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Bailey arising from the same conduct alleged in Wilcher v. City of Corinth, where Bailey was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.   The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Mississippi Department of Transportation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Mississippi Office of Inspector General in this matter."
