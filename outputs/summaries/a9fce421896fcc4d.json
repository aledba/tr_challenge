  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Hawaii yesterday entered a final judgment against Molokai Public Utilities, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kukui, Inc. (\"MPU\"), in which it agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b) thereunder, and to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $20,000.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Hawaii, alleges that Moloka's application for a water use permit expired on May 13, 1992, and that it did not intend to proceed with the contested case.  According to the complaint, however, the Commission improperly and prejudgmentally held that the letter was a clear and unambiguous waiver of MPU's right to continue with the water use application.  In its order, the court held that, because the complaint was filed in a contested case, Moloka\u2019s right to proceed was not unreasonable because it was an amendment to the existing permit application submitted by MPU, and thus did not constitute a waiver.  It also ruled that, in light of these findings, the Court should consider granting the Commission's motion for a temporary restraining order, granting a permanent injunction, and granting a request for a hearing on remand.  On May 2, 2008, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Gershfeld of the Hawaii District Court issued an order granting a preliminary injunction, granting an emergency court order, and issuing an order appointing a receiver to oversee the water treatment plant in the area.  To determine whether to grant the Commission a hearing or a hearing, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (Feb. 24, 2008).  The Commission's order, which was unsealed yesterday, requires all parties to submit a written response to the Commission on Remand by June 16, 2008.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, MPU has consented to the entry of an order that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to comply with the court's order.  MPU also has agreed to pay $25,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, which will be determined by the court at a later date.  Moloka'i has also agreed to a settlement that is subject to court approval.  This settlement is pending final approval by the Court of Hawaii.   The court also granted the Commission an emergency emergency court injunction, which requires MPU to comply"
