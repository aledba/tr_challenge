  "summary": "On December 19, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a final judgment against Dayton Police Officer Kevin Johnson and his co-inhabitant, Jeremy W. Hawks, on consent to entry and search of a home.  The court found that the officers had no reasonable basis to enter and search the home and that they did not have common authority to search the house.  According to the court's order, the officers entered the house through a side door and asked the individual, Dana Ray, if he was in the house and if he had common use of the area where Hawks lived.  As alleged in the court order, however, Ray did not consent to the officers' entry or search of the house, and the officers did not ask him about his \"common use\" or \"control\" over the area.  Instead, the court held that Ray had a \"good faith basis\" to allow the officers to enter the house without a warrant.  In its judgment, Johnson and Hawks consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, the defendants agreed to a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to comply with the entry-and-search provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against each of them.  Johnson and Cartee also agreed to be permanently enjoined from further violations of Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1.  Cartee agreed to settle the matter by consenting to entry of the home without a search warrant. The court also ordered the officer to sign a consent to search form, which requires him to sign before he can enter the home to provide a reasonable basis for a reasonable suspicion of whether the officer has common use or control over the house or any part of the premises.  On December 21, 2017, the Court granted the officer's motion for a temporary restraining order against the officer who conducted the search, ordering him to surrender his passport, and ordered him to pay a $20,500 civil penalty. The officer who performed the search was James Sisco, a resident of Dayton, Ohio.  Sisco agreed to the officer-in-law bar."
