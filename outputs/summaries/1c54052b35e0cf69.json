  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment in a class action action brought by Karmel Al Haj against Pfizer Inc. and its co-plaintiff, Timothy Woodhams, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Illinois on April 13, 2018, Al Haj alleges that, under Bristol-Myers Squibb, the company violated the federal securities laws by charging more for \"Maximum Strength\" Robitussin cough syrup than for \u201cRegular Strength\u201d Robitussian cough syrup, even though the former has a lower concentration of active ingredients than the latter.  The complaint also alleges that the defendants are not subject to specific jurisdiction over non-resident putative class members, as alleged in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Al Haj.  On May 16, 2019, the court granted Pfizer's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the amount of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying Al Haj's allegations, Pfizer has agreed to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations of the securities laws, and to pay a $10,000 civil penalty, which will be determined by the court at a later date. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Timothy J. Devlin. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Illinois Attorney General's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and to quickly and easily identify whether there is sufficient evidence to support their claims.
