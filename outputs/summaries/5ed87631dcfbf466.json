  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a company and its former president for violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed on April 29, 2015, alleges that Hector Rivera Ortiz (\u201cRivera\u201d) and his company, Special Police Force Corp. (SPF), violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  According to the complaint, SPF and Rivera agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In addition, the complaint alleges that SPF failed to maintain up-to-date records of its employees' hours worked.  SPF also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement and prejudgment interest paid to SPF.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  On March 7, 2018, the Honorable Court granted the SEC's motion for summary judgment against SPF, which was entered on April 6, 2017, and granted by the court a temporary restraining order against the defendants from violating the anti-fraud provisions, including Section 5 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 5b-5 thereunder, and ordered SPF to pay civil penalties of $25,000 and $50,000 for each hour worked by SPF employees during the period covered by the complaint and a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 5(b).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Rivera and SPF for their roles in the alleged violations of the federal reporting requirements of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) the Securities Act of 1933 and the reporting requirements under Section 15 of the Exchange Act.  To determine whether the SEC is entitled to summary judgment, the court has issued an order requiring the SEC to provide an accounting of SPF's alleged violations, which includes a determination as to whether it is liable for civil penalties.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2017.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Rivera, alleging that he violated the reporting provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of this federal securities law, and that he aided and abetted SPF violations of Rule 206(3).  The complaint also alleges that Rivera violated Section 10(b)(5) and 15(a)(2) of that federal securities code.  Without admitting, however, that he was not liable as an employer for the violations"
