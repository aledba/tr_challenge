  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who brought a civil injunctive action against two Idaho law enforcement officers for the use of excessive force.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on July 12, 2014, Steven Picatti, a resident of Eagle, Idaho, was arrested by two officers on foot patrol while attempting to evade arrest. The complaint alleges that Picatti confronted one of the officers and demanded to be restrained. Picatti allegedly refused to comply with the officer\u2019s orders to stop, and the officers allegedly tased Picatti in the face. The SEC alleges Picatti refused to cooperate with the officers, and Picatti was subsequently charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court granted Picatti a temporary restraining order and ordered Picatti to surrender his gun. The defendants agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott A. McCole and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the SEC Enforcement Division's Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be led by James L. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Amy C. Welshhans, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Idaho Department of Justice, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, the Utah Department of State Police, the Nevada Department of Banking and Securities, the Arizona Department of Motor Vehicles, the California Department of Insurance, the Colorado Department of Financial Regulation, the Washington Department of Health and Human Services, the Denver Department of Corrections, the Boise Police Department, the State Attorney General's Office Criminal Investigations Division, the Bureau of Justice's Office of Public Finance, the Office of the Inspector General's Retail Strategy Task Force, the Criminal Justice Division's Division of Economic and Risk Analysis and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
