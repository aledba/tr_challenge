  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida yesterday entered a final judgment against two prison officials for deliberate indifference to a serious medical need.  The SEC's complaint alleges that on April 9, 2010, two correctional officers took Harris to the prison to receive x-rays and an MRI.  According to the complaint, Harris was shackled with a waist chain, handcuffs, and restraints on both sides of his head and right arm and suffered severe head pain and dizziness.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the officers failed to order x-ray or an MRI of Harris's head, neck, and hands, and instead directed Harris to go to his dormitory and receive an emergency medical evaluation.  After Harris complained of severe pain, dizziness, and severe nausea, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Harris.  In a second amended complaint, filed in federal district court in Orlando, Florida, Harris alleges that the officers violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Rule 17a-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and from participating in any future conduct-based injunctive action.  On May 24, 2020, the U. S. District Judge for the Eastern District of New York entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(2)(A) and 5(B) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The judgment also orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and bars them from serving as officers or directors of any public company.   The court also granted the defendants the right to return to the institution where they were incarcerated. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Ostrove and supervised by Scott A. Mascianica.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Florida Department of Corrections, and the Alabama Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
