  "summary": "On August 24, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Orleans entered a final judgment against Officer Terrance Saulny, who was terminated from his employment with the New Orleans Police Department following an investigation of a September 24, 2014 juvenile detention incident.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, Off. Saulny violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that, as alleged in the complaint, Saulny engaged in \"text book\" passive resistance by folding her arms and failing to comply with the officer's directions, and that, in the course of engaging in this conduct, he violated the use of force provisions of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint or the SEC, Off.\" Saulny agreed to the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the policy, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $160,000.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC also issued an order imposing an officer-and-officer bar against Saulny.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rivet and Eric Werner of the SEC Enforcement Division's Office of Inspector General, with the assistance of the Office of the Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Louisiana, and the New Orleanian Police Department."
