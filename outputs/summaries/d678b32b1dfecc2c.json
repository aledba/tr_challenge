  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Keystone Mutual Insurance Co. (\"Keystone\"), an insurance company that focuses its business on insuring physicians in a small number of low-risk specialties, including ear, nose, and throat physicians.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, Dr. Berkowitz applied for insurance with Keystone in 2010 and received a judgment in February 2013, agreeing to pay $870,625.23 with prejudgment interest of 9 percent.  The complaint alleges that Dr Berkowitz, who had been insured by Keystone for a time, filed a civil injunctive action in 2011 against Keystone for breach of contract, alleging that the insurance policy was void ab initio and that he had no right to rescind the policy.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Keystone consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1 million plus interest, which was reduced later to $\u2002680,000 with taxable costs and interest, and a $25,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Dr. Bekowitz.   The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can\u00c2\u00a0find investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov to quickly and easily check whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office."
