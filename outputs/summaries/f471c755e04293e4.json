  "summary": "On August 21, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment against D.C.-based managed care organization Chartered Health Plan, Inc. (\"Chartered\") for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Washington, DC, Chartered sought a court-ordered reorganization of its business to provide services to approximately 110,000 District residents enrolled in the nationally-funded Medicaid program.  The complaint alleges that Chartered agreed to be placed into rehabilitation pursuant to the Reorganization Order and agreed to pay $48 million to settle claims that it had overpaid for certain services.  As alleged in the complaint, however, this settlement is not subject to subject-matter jurisdiction.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Chartered.  Among other things, the SEC alleges that DCHSI failed to comply with a court order requiring it to submit an asset purchase agreement and reorganization plan for Chartered, and failed to timely approve the reorganization order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the court agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their ill-gotten gains.  On August 24, 2016, the Honorable Judge Melvin R. Wright issued an order requiring the defendants to submit to the court a plan of rehabilitation that would result in payment of the company's obligations under the Exchange Act, and require them to provide for the rehabilitation of Chartered's assets.  This order also requires that the defendants submit to court approval of any settlement that is deemed necessary or appropriate to reform and revitalize the company.    The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Scott A. Birkenheier. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Utah Office of Inspector General."
