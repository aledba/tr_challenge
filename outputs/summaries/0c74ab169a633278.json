  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Colorado today entered a final judgment against Gary V. Richardson, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to sixteen years in prison for his role in an attempted second-degree assault and attempted third-degree felony.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Richardson, who has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Richardson.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Denver, Richardson failed to adequately disclose to the jury that he engaged in a pattern of misconduct that led him to commit multiple felony counts, including two counts of attempted second degree assault or attempted third degree assault and possession of a weapon by a previous offender.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Richardson agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from participating in future securities law violations, imposes a conduct-based injunction, and requires him to comply with a court order requiring him to show cause and effect a determination of whether a defendant is competent to participate in a fair and impartial trial.  Richardson also agreed to be barred from serving as a judge or jury member by the court for a five-year period ending in June 2020.    The SEC also issued an order suspending Richardson from appearing or practicing before the SEC as a juror, barring him from associating with any law enforcement organization, and from participating on a jury for at least five years. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Denver Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Colorado Department of Criminal Justice, and the Colorado State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
