  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah yesterday entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of drug possession in a high-speed chase that led to the destruction of two backpacks full of drugs and drug paraphernalia.  The court also issued a temporary restraining order halting the defendant from further violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b)(5) thereunder.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Gilliard.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Salt Lake City, Utah, Gilliard was charged with possession of a controlled substance with the intent to distribute and with operating a rental car without a valid driver's license.  Gilliard agreed to the court's order and agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar, and to be barred from appearing before the court as an attorney.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $2,500, and orders him not to participate in the offering of a penny stock or in the sale of any penny stock at any time until the court has a reasonable opportunity to rule on the merits of the case.   The SEC also issued an order suspending Gilliard from appearing or practicing before the SEC as a lawyer.  It also ordered Gilliard to submit an oral history of his past convictions, which he did not do, and ordered him to submit a written history of the past five years in which he provided testimony in support of his convictions.  Finally, the court granted Gilliard the right to a hearing and to have a jury trial.  On May 2, 2018, the SEC issued a subpoena for a copy of the subpoena, which was obtained by the SEC through an SEC complaint filed in the U.K. Division of Criminal Justice. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Salt Lake Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Department of Public Safety, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Utah State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
