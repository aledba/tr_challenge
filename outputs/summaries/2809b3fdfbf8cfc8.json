  "summary": "On May 23, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against PECO Energy, Inc., a service distribution company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges that, from October 2013 through October 2014, Claimant was suspended pending a job review due to an incident in which he threw a bottle of hand soap at a fellow employee and was escorted off the premises.  According to the complaint, the Department of Labor and Industry did not have jurisdiction to issue a final determination on whether or not a claimant was eligible for benefits and instead imposed a fault overpayment and penalties.  Claimant's complaint alleges that the Department improperly imposed fault overpay and penalties on him based on his violation of safety rules and \"actions that were threatening, intimidating, and physically aggressive.\"  The complaint further alleges that on October 17, 2013, after he filed for benefits in October 2013, he received an employer's October 14, 2013 letter notifying him that he had been discharged for unacceptable and improper conduct.  On November 5, 2014, the Board of Review issued a decision that permanently enjoins Employer from issuing or denying any UC benefits to any base-year employer or last employer of the claimant during the claimant's benefit year for a week, the last day of which is subsequent to the date on which the determination was issued.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Employer consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $14,768, and imposing a $2,215.20 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Claimant for his role in the alleged scheme.  A hearing that followed was held on May 24, 2017 and was supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, under the supervision of Eric R. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the Federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission in this matter."
