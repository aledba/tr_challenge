  "summary": "On May 21, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Ohio entered a final judgment against Carrols LLC d/b/a Burger King, LLC and three of its former supervisors and/or managers for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, on August 1, 2006, Carrol's entered into an arbitration agreement that required employees to arbitrate disputes arising out of or relating to their employment. The arbitration agreement, however, did not require employees to sign a copy of the agreement. Instead, the agreement required all new employees to do so.  The complaint alleges that, by reporting to work on or after August 1 in 2006, an employee agreed to the arbitration agreement and to join all known claims together in one action. The complaint further alleges that at the time he was hired as shift supervisor and took on certain managerial duties, the employee did not sign the agreement and did not participate in the arbitration.  In addition, as alleged in the complaint, the contract does not require current employees to participate in arbitration, and neither does it require arbitration when the employee has the option of participating in a concerted, or collective, action.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the above-mentioned provisions. The final judgments also order the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  On May 22, 2017, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Burt of the Ohio Court of Common Pleas granted the defendants' motion to compel arbitration based on the facts of the case. The court granted the parties' request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar. The order also requires the parties to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the parties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221, July 17, 2017."
