  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts today entered judgment against Monsanto Company, Solutia, Inc., and Pharmacia Corporation in a multi-million dollar remediation case brought by the town of Westport, Massachusetts.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston on May 4, 2014, Westport alleges that Monsanto began to manufacture and sell PCB mixtures, trademarked as Aroclors, in 1935. The complaint alleges that, from 1935 through 1969, Monsanto manufactured and sold a variety of products that contained PCBs, including a type of caulk that contained the chemical. In addition, according to the complaint, Monsanto used caulk containing PCBs to manufacture paints and sealants for swimming pools, paints and waterproofing agents in silos and other buildings where food products for humans or animals are stored, and as a component of any container of wrapping used in packaging food products. The SEC alleges that the company failed to adequately disclose to its direct customers that there was a risk PCBs would volatilize from caulk at levels harmful to human health, and that, in 1969, there was no scientific evidence to support Monsanto's claim that the risk was reasonably foreseeable in 1969. In fact, the complaint alleges, Monsanto supplied the caulk used at WMS to Product Research & Chemical Corporation (PRC) for manufacturing and distribution of the additive. In August of 1970, Monsanto pulled PCB-containing caulk from the market because of its environmental impact.  The complaint charges Monsanto with violating the implied warranty of merchantability under the federal securities laws and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Economic and Risk Analysis today announced that it has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of PCBs in the marketplace.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling them investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint charges Westport with violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940.   The Complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and injunctive relief."
