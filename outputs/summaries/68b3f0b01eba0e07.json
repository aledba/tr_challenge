  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of a felony shoplifting conspiracy.  The court entered the final judgment in favor of the defendant, Amaya Monique Martin.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, Martin, a recidivist thief, entered into a scheme to steal cosmetics in the United States and sell them in Latin America. The complaint alleges that Martin entered the store with the intent to steal the cosmetics, but was stopped by a security guard who recognized her as a potential threat to the public. The SEC further alleges that the defendants entered into the scheme with the intention of stealing the cosmetics and were caught by security guards and the police. The court found that Martin violated the antifraud provisions of Section 459.5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, and 13b2-3 thereunder. Martin agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The final judgment, which permanently enjoins Martin from violating the antitrust provisions of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and bars her from serving any prison term. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Martin. The case was investigated by the Office of Inspector General's Retail Strategy Task Force, which is in the process of evaluating whether to charge Martin with a felony for shoplifting. The litigation will be led by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Banking and Securities, the Internal Revenue Service, and the California Office of Financial Regulation."
