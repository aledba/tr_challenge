  "summary": "On September 29, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Minnesota entered a final judgment against the City of West St. Paul, its mayor, and several other defendants for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants, who are also charged with violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act.  According to the court's order, filed on August 29, 2016, the City Council passed an Ordinance prohibiting certain sex offenders from residing within 2000 feet of school, day care centers, or day care facilities. The court found that the Ordinance violated the federal securities laws, and that the city violated its obligations to the states.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Evenstad. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the District of Columbia, charges Evenstad with violating the anti-fraud provision of the federal criminal laws. The complaint seeks a preliminary injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Evenstad consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17."
