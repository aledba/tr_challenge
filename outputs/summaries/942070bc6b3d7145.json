  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the Social Security Administration (SSA) in a related case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that, on December 8, 2009, Judge Robert T. Harvey of the SEC's New York Regional Office improperly concluded that, through March 7, 2003, a person with a discogenic lumbar spine who had relatively minor physical impairments was capable of performing a limited range of light work.  According to the complaint, the SSA's conclusion was unsupported by substantial evidence.  For example, the complaint alleges that Donald Shader, a licensed physical therapist who testified at the July 24, 2013 hearing, had testified that Plaintiff's impairments satisfied the requirements of Listing 1.04A.  Shader also testified that, during the relevant time period, Plaintiff had difficulty using stairs, fitting into small places, sitting in chairs comfortably, walking, and engaging in \"general activity.\"  The complaint further alleges that Shader's testimony was internally inconsistent, and the SEC improperly discounted the testimony of a vocational expert who had testified at that hearing.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the SEC consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the SEC from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the SEC to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order appointing a receiver to determine whether a claimant has a history of depression and/or bipolar disorder, and ordering the receiver to conduct an independent examination of the person's condition.  On May 17, 2015, the Honorable Judge Harvey granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order against further violations of the federal securities laws and ordered the receiver be enjoined from future violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4), and to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Judge Harvey also granted the Commission's request for an asset freeze and an officer-and-director bar against the receiver.   The Commission's order, which was entered by the SEC on June 17, 2014, was approved by the court without prejudice to the relief sought by the Commission. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Sansone, Eric R. Werner, and Glenn S. Gordon of the New York Office of the Inspector General."
