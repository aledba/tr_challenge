  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two brothers who were convicted in a multi-pronged drug conspiracy.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York on March 1, 2016, Eliu and Waldemar Lorenzana-Cordon agreed to settle the charges against them by agreeing to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also ordered the brothers to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  The brothers also agreed to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central American and Caribbean today announced criminal charges against the brothers.  On March 2, 2017, the SEC filed an emergency action against the two brothers, charging them with violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the brothers consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay civil penalties of $1,500, $100,000, and a $50,000 civil penalty for each of the brothers, and orders each of them to disgorge their gains with prejudgment interest and pay a civil penalty of $500,000. The brothers agreed to the judgment, which also prohibits them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any controlled substance, including, without limitation, the purchase, sale, distribution, or promotion of any drug. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (March 17, 2016).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.N. Office of International Affairs, the UCCA, the Swiss Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority in this matter."
