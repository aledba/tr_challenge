  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found liable for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Maryland, alleges that on September 20, 2005, the Maryland Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order preventing a defendant from filing a motion for Modification of Sentence. The court granted the defendant's motion for modification of sentence and, on March 20, 2013, the court granted him the right to file a belated motion for reduction of sentence within five years from the date the original sentence was imposed on the defendant. The SEC alleges that, in 2008, when the defendant appeared for a probation violation hearing, he requested that his trial counsel from the resentencing hearing file a motion to modify his sentence. The judge granted the request for modification within one year of the original sentencing date, but did not grant the defendant the opportunity to file the motion until almost a year after the sentencing date.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Maryland today announced criminal charges against an individual for his role in the alleged scheme.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed on January 10, 2017, the trial court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from future violations of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rules 5b-5 and 5c-8 thereunder, and orders the defendant to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions, and ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2014, a federal district court in Maryland granted the court's order granting the defendant relief. On August 31, 2012, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendant, charging him with violating Rule 4-345, and with violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b2-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and the appointment of a receiver for the receiver of the receiver's receiver.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John R. Rymas of the Office of the Chief of the Baltimore Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson."
