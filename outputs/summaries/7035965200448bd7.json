  "summary": "On April 26, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Montana entered a final judgment against defendant Psychiatric Medical Care, LLC (PMC) in a civil injunctive action brought by the District Court against PMC.  The court found that PMC violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, PMC failed to timely produce documents related to its termination of a program therapist.  PMC also failed to inform Webster of the destruction of her personnel file.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the company.  On May 2, 2020, the court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered PMC to comply with its discovery obligations.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Libby, Montana, charges PMC with violations of Rule 37(a)(1) and Rule 37b2-3 thereunder, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, PMc agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  It also imposes a $75,000 civil penalty against PMc.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The court granted the SEC's motion for a temporary injunction and ordered the destruction and destruction of the documents.  To determine whether to impose the civil penalty, see Litigation Release No. 1367-70.  Separately, the Court granted a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 1602.14 of the Exchange Act and Rules 16b-20, 13a-1, and 13b-11 thereunder and a $50,000 penalty for further violations of the reporting requirements of Section 17(a) of Exchange Act Rule 17(b)(5) and Rules 17a-3 and (4) and (5) thereunder of Rule 17d-1 thereunder; and a penalty for aiding and abetting PMC's violations of Exchange Order No. 17(e) of 1940 and Rule 17c-3.  For further information, see Judgment No. 18-cv-1-2019 (Exchange Act).  The Court also granted a partial injunction against further violation of Rule 1602, and a partial bar against further destruction of materials in its possession or over which it may exercise control"
