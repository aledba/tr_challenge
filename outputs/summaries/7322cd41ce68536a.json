  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the court against Stowell.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that, in violation of Section 4.8(3), Stowell has the unilateral right to relocate the easements.  According to the complaint, Stowell agreed to the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the court, and agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000 and a civil penalty of $1,000.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against Stow.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge James W. Kerstetter of the Boston Regional Office issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering Stowell to comply with the court's order. The order also ordered Stow to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court on May 25, 2018. The court granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze and other emergency relief, including an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver, and ordering the receiver to provide an accounting of any lost or injured property located on the receiver's property. The SEC also issued an emergency asset freeze, which was instituted in the wake of the September 11, 2010, Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre.  To learn more about asset freezes, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (2014).  The complaint also charges Stowell with violating Section 17(a)(1) of The Exchange Act and Rule 17a-3 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil money penalties, and a penny stock bar.  For further information on easements and related issues, see Property Bulletin Bulletin No. 13-20, 2014.   The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
