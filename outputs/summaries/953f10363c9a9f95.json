  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Utah today entered a final judgment finding that Paragon Contractors Corporation and its president, Brian Jessop, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, charges Paragon and Jessop with violating Section 203 of the Fair Labor Standards Act.  According to the complaint, from 2007 through 2008, the Southern Utah Pecan Ranch owned over 100 acres of pecans in Utah. The complaint alleges that, as a result of this conduct, the children were not employed as part of the company's business and were not entitled to compensation for their labor.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Paragon. The SEC also announced related civil injunctive relief, including an order requiring Paragon to pay $200,000 into a fund managed by the Department of Labor to compensate the children for their unpaid work.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2017.   The complaint also names Paragon & Jessop as a defendant in violation of Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206-8 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 203, as well as an order appointing a special master to monitor the children\u2019s employment. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Utah Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
