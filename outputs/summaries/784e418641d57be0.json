  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of second-degree murder in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that on February 6, 2016, defendant made a Batson challenge to a jury that included African-American jurors. The complaint alleges that defendant had been investigated by the Department of Justice (DOJ) on two prior occasions resulting in valid findings of abuse as to J.D.  According to the complaint, the jury deliberated for approximately one hour before finding that defendant was liable to a forty-year sentence based on the evidence presented to the jury. The SEC alleges that the jury found defendant liable because he had been disciplined by the DOJ for his \"disciplining\" of his two sons. The court also found that defendant did not have sufficient evidence to justify the imposition of a penalty.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against defendant, who was later sentenced to prison for second- and third-degree felony murder.  On February 8, 2017, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against defendant and ordered him to be enjoined from future securities law violations.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The order also prohibits defendant from associating with any third- or fourth-tier law enforcement agency.  A hearing on February 9, 2017 was conducted by Assistant Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Baton Rouge Regional Office, and the case was supervised by Assistant Director of the Division of Criminal Justice. The litigation will be led by Mr. Faucetta and Ms. Kelly. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Louisiana Department of State's Office of Criminal Investigations, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Orleans Office of Inspector General, the United States Postal Inspection Service, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the Baton Rouge Police Department, the FBI Criminal Investigations Unit, the Mississippi Department of Banking and Securities and the Louisiana State Attorney General's Office."
