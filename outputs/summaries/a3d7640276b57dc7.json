  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against a Texas-based neurosurgeon who was found liable for his negligent performance of a back surgery.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Helson Pacheco-Serrant, who was also a trial judge, negligently performed a spinal fusion, dislocation, spondylolisthesis, and frank neurogenic compromise.  According to the complaint, filed in federal district court in Dallas, Texas, Dr. Barrash provided an expert report on the spinal fusion in January 2013 that failed to adequately identify the cause of the injury, the severity of the injuries, and the manner in which the surgery was performed.  In addition, the expert report failed to identify any underlying causes of the patient\u2019s alleged loss of bladder control.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000 and a civil penalty of $100,000.  On May 20, 2015, the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment against Barrash, ordering him to be enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against him.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for September 21, 2015.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221.  This case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Fort Worth Regional Office.  An SEC investigation was conducted by David A. Kasper and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson."
