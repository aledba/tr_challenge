  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was sentenced to 78 months in prison for soliciting an obscene visual depiction of a minor in violation of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that David A. Bridgewater contacted a boy who he thought was named \u201cStephen\u201d on Grindr, an online dating application. According to the complaint, Bridgewater told the boy that he wanted to make out and perform oral sex on him and that he was going to counsel him regarding his risky conduct. The complaint further alleges that Bridgewater did not simply solicit an obscene picture of himself, he attempted to entice the minor to meet him in person for sex. Instead, the complaint alleges, Bridgewater engaged in a pattern of conduct that is inconsistent with the federal sentencing guidelines. Bridgewater also allegedly told the victim that he had been bullied as a child; sexually abused himself; had many medical challenges, including HIV which he battled for over 20 years; and had been falsely told he was a cop or detective or law enforcement. In addition, Bridgewater allegedly solicited the solicitation of a sexual image of himself on the internet, which is all that matters when sentencing a defendant. The SEC alleges that, in reality, Bridgewater had no criminal history, no criminal record, and no prior felony conviction. The court found that Bridgewater violated the antifraud provisions of Section 3553 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Bridgewater has agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Bridgewater. The case was investigated by the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Justice's Office of Criminal Justice. The litigation will be led by Mr. Bridgewater and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Police Department, and the Illinois Attorney General's Office in this matter."
