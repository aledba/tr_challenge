  "summary": "On January 10, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico entered a temporary restraining order against Mark Peters, a New Mexico resident, and his company, Peters Appraisals, Inc., in an amended complaint alleging that Peters violated the antifraud provisions of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 15(b) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, alleges that Peters and Peters' companies violated the federal securities laws by failing to timely file with the SEC their amended complaint.  According to the complaint, Peters and his companies failed to timely respond to the SEC's requests for leave to amend the complaint and instead filed a second amended complaint with the court.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws, and orders Peters to pay a civil penalty of $75,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Nevada today announced criminal charges against Peters.  On January 10th, the Honorable M. Christina Armijo of the federal district court for the Central District of California granted the SEC and Peters a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 1447 of the Exchange Act, and ordered Peters to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000, which would be equal to Peters' disgorgement of $50,000 plus interest and penalties.  To learn more about diversity in the federal court system, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1447 (D.N.M. July 17, 2018).  The complaint also charges Peters with violating Rule 15a, which requires a court to determine whether a defendant has the right to amend a complaint before it is submitted to the court, and with aiding and abetting Peters' violations of Rule 1447. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction against Peters, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar against Peters and the Haynes.  For further information about diversity, see litigation release No. 13-cv. 1447(e).  In addition, the complaint charges Peters, Peters, and Adams with violating Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, and charges Adams with violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(B)(3)(B).  Peters and Adams are also charged with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(3) of"
