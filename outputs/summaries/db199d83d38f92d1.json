  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of West Virginia today entered a final judgment in favor of a woman who was terminated from her position as a certified CT technician.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charleston, South Carolina, alleges that, prior to the court's order denying her motion to relocate, Stacey J. (\u201cMother\u201d) filed a motion to modify the custodial arrangement for her children, alleging that as a result of Father\u2019s work schedule, he had less time to spend with the children.  According to the complaint, the family court ultimately ruled that Mother could not relocate the children because she did not have custodial responsibility for the children at least seventy percent of the time.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's order, the mother consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 48-9-403 of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $612.96.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of South Carolina today announced criminal charges against Mother.  On August 9, 2018, the court granted the mother's motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered her to comply with the court order by issuing an order permanently enjoining her from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions, ordering her to surrender her passport, and imposing a $612,961 civil penalty against her.  A hearing scheduled for October 1, 2018 is scheduled for 10 a.m. Eastern Time.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221."
