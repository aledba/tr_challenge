  "summary": "On May 9, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment against two officers of the Gardner City Police Department (the \"Gardner Police\") and the Massachusetts State Police (the \u201cState Police\u201d) for failing to adequately train or supervise their respective employees.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Massachusetts, Joseph and Christina Wolski received a phone call from Eric McAvene, the state's attorney, telling him to return to the station for an urgent meeting.  The complaint alleges that the subpoena requested the cellphone records of the officers involved in the investigation, including the Wolskis' cell phone.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the subpoena did not exist and never did.  Instead, the complaint alleges, the defendants allegedly demanded that the officer turn over his personal, private \"Apple I.D. and password\" and permit the troopers to perform a \"data dump\" on the officers' cell phones.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the Defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael Travers and Matthew Prescott of the Boston Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Travers. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Massachusetts Department of Justice, the Boston Police Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the Pennsylvania Department of State Police, the Connecticut Department of Insurance, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, the New England Department of Corrections, the State Police's Criminal Investigations Division, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Criminal Investigation Division's Office of Inspector General, the Division of Enforcement's Cyber Unit, as well as the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Cyber Unit. The litigation is being led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Powell. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC encourages the public to check the background of anyone offering or offering them an attorney by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investigative.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
