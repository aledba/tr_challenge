  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Orleans today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon in a second-degree murder case.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Don Michael Raines, who was living with Raines at the Contempo Apartments in Hammond, told Raines that he was going to go hit a lick, which is street talk for \"to try to get any means of money\" or \"to do something wrong.\" According to the complaint, Raines also allegedly told the victim that he had an \"easy lick\" for money from a white female who was riding in a car. The complaint further alleges that Raines allegedly used the victim's car to drive her to New Orleans and \"set the car on fire.\" The complaint alleges Raines' girlfriend Elexis Maryland, her brother, and her daughter were among the victims of the alleged crime. The SEC alleges that, on the morning of October 19, 2014, the defendant called Raines and told him that a girl going to get some smoke would be coming through and she would pull up across the street and hit the car. Raines replied that he didn't want to know about the car and that he just wanted to give the victim a few minutes to give her a chance to give him a little more than an hour. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Raines from further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Raines to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana today announced criminal charges.  On November 2, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action and obtained an emergency court order freezing Raines's assets and ordering him to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest. The case was supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Amy C. McKinley."
