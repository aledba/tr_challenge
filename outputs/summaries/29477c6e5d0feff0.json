  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant convicted of indecent exposure in violation of the federal securities laws.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the defendant and ordered him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York on April 12, 2016, the court found that the sentencing guidelines provided for a \"1 day to life\" sentencing option for a sexually delinquent person were inconsistent with the federal sentencing guidelines. The court further found that, contrary to the representations in the complaint, the defendants were not subject to mandatory minimum sentencing and instead were subject to an \"indeterminate sentence\" that was optional, not mandatory.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against one of the defendants in connection with the same conduct.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The judgment also orders the defendant to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penalty equal to the amount of time he has already been sentenced to in a criminal case. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Division of Criminal Justice. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
