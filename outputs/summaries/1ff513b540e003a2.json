  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida today announced charges against two Orange County Sheriff's Office officers for their roles in an undercover operation targeting sexual predators who use the internet to solicit children.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, on August 8, 2011, Kenneth Hochstein was arrested as part of a multi-agency undercover operation known as \"Operation Spider Web.\" The complaint alleges that, while in custody, Officer Graves and his supervisor, Sheriff Jerry Demings, engaged in an unregistered and unregistered solicitation of a minor in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that Officer Graves violated his duty as a law enforcement officer by failing to show reasonable cause to arrest him.  The complaint further alleges that the officers violated their duty to protect the innocent and serve as a deterrent.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Central District of New York today entered a final judgment against Officer Graves that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078.71, and orders Demings to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and ordering them each to pay civil penalties in the amount of $150,000 each.  On November 30, 2015, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in the U.K. District Court against Officer Brunscheen, who was also charged with violating the federal anti-fraud provisions. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael R. Kasper and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Miami Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Kasunder."
