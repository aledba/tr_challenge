  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against California Secretary of Transportation Secretary Kathleen L. Napolitano in a civil action brought by Mayra Alvarado.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that, on January 16, 2008, a California Coach FSP tow truck driver hit a car on Interstate 5, injuring Mayra and her child.  According to the complaint, the tow truck drivers were hired by California Coach Orange, Inc. (\"California Coach\"), a private company owned and operated by CHP, to perform tow truck services on California's busiest highways.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, that California Coach was not a \"special employer\" because it did not have the right to control job performance.  In addition, the complaint alleges that CHP's role as a \"servant\" in the FSP program was inconsistent with that of a state agency.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, California Coach agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  California Coach also agreed to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  Caltrans agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering it to provide for an accounting of its assets, and to pay civil penalties of $20,000 and $50,000, respectively. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Deborah M. Welshhans of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia entered a judgment against CHP that permanently restrains the agency's liability as a special employer, and requires it to submit a civil injunctive action to the court. The court also ordered CHP to comply with an order appointing a receiver to oversee the transfer of assets from the agency to the receiver. The SEC is continuing its investigation into the matter of whether California Coach violated the reporting provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of its securities laws. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Enforcement's Public Finance Abuse Unit."
