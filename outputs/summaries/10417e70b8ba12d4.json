  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former commercial laundry facility production supervisor who was found liable for his tinnitus.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that James M. Peeples, a former supervisor at Aramark Uniform Services, Inc., falsely claimed that he suffered a work-related accident that caused him to experience bilateral titus. According to the complaint, however, Dr. Cohen was the only two medical experts to testify regarding the cause of Claimant\u2019s symptoms. The complaint alleges that, contrary to his testimony, Dr Cohen was not persuasive or not credible because he offered no evidence to support the Commission's award and his own evaluation of him was not supported by sufficient competent evidence. In addition, the SEC alleges that Dr. Ostrove, a registered representative at DePaul Hospital Emergency Room, rated Claimant as 20% permanently and partially disabled because of the chronic bilateral tone of his voice. Claimant also allegedly complained of mild ringing in his right ear and difficulty concentrating and sleeping for the first time after seeing his primary care physician. The SEC also found that, after the work related accident, Claimant developed ringing in both of his ears, which did not limit his daily activities. The Commission's final judgment, which was entered on June 21, 2018, permanently enjoins Claimant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Missouri today announced parallel criminal charges against Claimant. In a related matter, the Department of Justice today announced that it has issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the investigation of the matter. The receiver has agreed to the appointment without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's order. The receivership order also requires the receiver to provide a copy of the complaint to the receiver. The investigation was conducted by David M. Wilkins and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Messrs. Welshhans and Wilkins. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Missouri Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
