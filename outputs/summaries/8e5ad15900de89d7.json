  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered final judgments against Sterling R. Macer, Sr. and his wife, Delores, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that Sterling Jr. sought reimbursement of attorney's fees and expenses incurred in connection with a prior Missouri guardianship proceeding.  According to the complaint, the probate court granted Sterling Jr.'s request for reimbursement on February 20, 2017, but did not approve the reimbursement.  Sterling Jr., who was incapacitated at the time, filed a second motion for reconsideration on April 1, 2016, and filed a supplemental motion on June 16, 2016.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Sterling Jr..  The complaint also alleges that, in a related proceeding, Sterling Sr. failed to follow the statutory procedures governing claims against a person and estate, and failed to file a timely application for reimbursement of his attorney\u2019s fees.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay disgorgement of $131,631 plus prejudgment interest of $2,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.   The settlements are subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 578 (January 24, 2017).  The case is being handled by John R. Rymas of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office, under the supervision of Eric R. Werner of the Division of Enforcement's Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a separate case, the SEC filed an emergency action in which it obtained an emergency court order granting the emergency court's approval of the emergency order.  Among other things, the court issued an order requiring the payment of attorney fees to a trustee under the power of attorney, and requiring the trustee to submit a supporting affidavit. "
