  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of felony fourth-degree assault and attempted murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, on March 19, 2015, a defendant drove to the victim's apartment and then laid in wait behind the victim\u2019s car with a three-foot-long machete. As alleged in the complaint, the defendant used a long, sharp object to strike the victim in the head multiple times, fracturing her skull, and causing a \"minor brain bleed.\"  The complaint further alleges that the defendant then used a baseball bat to attack the victim, causing a six-inch diagonal cut across her upper right forehead, down between her eyes, over the bridge of her nose, and extending over her right cheekbone.  According to the SEC, the victim was not injured, and the defendant did not commit any additional felony.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New York announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On March 24, 2016, the U. S. District Judge for the Northern District of California entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendant to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $2,038, and imposing a $100,000 civil penalty against the other defendant. The court also ordered the defendant not to violate the pre-judgmental provisions of Sections 137.123(5)(a) and (c) thereunder of the criminal laws, and to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $75,000 for each of the three counts of first- and second-degree assaults. The judge also granted the defendant a temporary restraining order prohibiting him from using a firearm and from associating with any third- or fourth-party criminal organization. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see State v. Breshears, 206 Or. App. 552, 554, and 393 P.3d 206 (2014).  The court granted the state's request for a preliminary injunction against future violations, and ordered a conduct-based injunction against further violations."
