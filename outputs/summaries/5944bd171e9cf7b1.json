  "summary": "On June 24, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against Fuji, Inc., a California-based manufacturer of single-use disposable cameras, for fraudulently transferring assets to a third party.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, Fuji and its third defendant, Yet \"Jimmy\" Chan, engaged in a fraudulent transfer of approximately $700,000 in cash and his quitclaim to the third defendant.  The SEC alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Fuji and Chan violated the \"primary rights\" provision of the federal securities laws by transferring Chan's interest in the Appalachian Way Property to another defendant for the purpose of frustrating Fuji's ability to enforce the settlement agreement.  As alleged in the complaint, Fuji was not required to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Fuji from future violations of the securities laws, and orders Fuji to pay a civil penalty of $450,404.33, a penalty equal to the amount of its disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $3.25 million.  Fuji also agreed to a settlement where it would be jointly and severally liable with the members of the Achiever Group for any amount of money or interest in property transferred to it by the defendants other than for the payment of a double recovery.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Fuji agreed to the settlement and agreed to be barred from future actions arising out of the same conduct.  On June 26, 2014, the court granted Fuji's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order appointing a receiver to determine whether any transfer from Chan to the defendant-corporation was a legitimate transfer. The court also denied Fuji's motion for a preliminary injunction, which would have prevented Fuji from pursuing its fraudulent transfer claims in the future. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Eric R. Kasper and Carol A. McKinley of the San Francisco Regional Office, with assistance from Joseph G. Sansone of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, and was supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The examination was conducted in the Office of Compliance and Advocacy for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
