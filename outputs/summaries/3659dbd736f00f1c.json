  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments in favor of the Hubbell Family Trusts, which are intended to distribute trust principal to the children of Harvey Hubbell III and his wife Virginia W. Hubbell.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, Connecticut, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that, in violation of Section 303 of the Restatement of Property, the judge improperly instructed the defendants to use the term \"issue\" in the trust documents to determine the amount of trust principal distributed among the children.  In addition, the court found that, contrary to the defendants' representations to the court, the trust principal should be distributed at the level of the children, regardless of whether the children are living at the time the trust was created.  For example, the complaint further alleges that the defendants failed to consider the issue of whether children should serve as the stirpital roots of the trust when distributing trust principal.  As a result of the court's order, the jury found the defendants liable for violations of Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and impose civil penalties of up to $100,000.  Additionally, the Court granted the Defendants' motion for summary judgment against the defendants, which is subject to court approval, and ordered the settlement of the matter.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John R. Kelly and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Kelly, Ms. Gibson, and Ms. Kelly.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Connecticut Department of Banking and Securities, and the Connecticut Office of Financial Regulation."
