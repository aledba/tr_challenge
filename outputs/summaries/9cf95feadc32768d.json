  "summary": "On September 18, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a Bridgeport man for his role in a September 2015 assault that resulted in a total of five felony convictions.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Bridgeport, Connecticut, alleges that defendant Raphael Morais violated the antifraud provisions of Section 53 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Morais confronted his girlfriend, who was at the club at the time, and confronted the defendant. The complaint alleges that Morais replied, \"it's him.\"  The complaint further alleges that the defendant then confronted the girlfriend and made offensive remarks to her.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Morais.  On October 27, 2018, a federal district court in Connecticut issued a temporary restraining order halting the alleged misconduct of the Bridgeport Police Department's Criminal Investigations Division, which was conducting an investigation into the alleged inadequacy of the state's response to the September 12, 2015 assault. The court's order temporarily halted the investigation and ordered the Division of Criminal Investigations to conduct a parallel criminal investigation.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000, $20,000 in disgorgement, and $1,500 in prejudgment interest, and requires the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $50,000.  A jury trial is scheduled for October 26, 2019. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Connecticut Attorney General's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments in an investment in a real estate development project."
