  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against Spire Missouri, Inc., a Missouri-based gas corporation and public utility, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. Louis, Missouri, alleges that Spire violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that the Commission improperly ordered Spire to pay over $4.9 million in pre-judgment interest and a $1.2 million penalty in connection with the 2017 infrastructure surcharges. Spire agreed not to challenge the Commission\u2019s recommendation, and agreed to a settlement where the Commission would determine how to determine the amount of excess surcharges and, if any, how to recover those costs. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Spire also agreed to the entry of a judgment that would require it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and that it would not impose a penalty on Spire until the court ruled on the eligibility or amount of any of the additional costs in the 2017 projects. The Commission previously issued an order that it deemed ineligible for recovery in the 2016 infrastructure surcharge cases. The SEC previously issued a finding that it lacked the statutory authority to order a refund of all of those costs, including the costs of replacing plastic mains and service lines, and to issue a determination on the appropriate amount of the refund or return of excess charges.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the company.  On March 17, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action, seeking a temporary restraining order, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The court granted the SEC's request for a preliminary injunction, entered an order appointing a receiver for the receiver, and issued a final order ordering the receiver to respond to any emergency action by the receiver. The receiver has not yet responded to the Commission's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Spire and the receiver have agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the issuance of an order requiring them to pay civil penalties of $2.8 million and $1 million, respectively, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date. The receivers have also agreed that the receiver will not be able to recover any excess charges from Spire without a court order requiring it to do so. In addition, the receiver has agreed to pay $2 million in interest and to a $100,000 penalty."
