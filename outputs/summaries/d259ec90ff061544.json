The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Thibodaux, Mississippi, alleges that Jonathan Corn, a licensed social worker, was employed as a forensic interviewer at the center in Haughton, Louisiana. According to the complaint, Corn was convicted of first-degree felony molestation of a juvenile by a jury of twelve members of the agency's Child Abuse Unit. Corn was sentenced to 25 years of hard labor, without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, with credit for time served.

The complaint further alleges that on January 1, 2019, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an order appointing a receiver, and an officer and director of a public school to conduct an investigation into the alleged misconduct.  On March 24, 2018 the SEC charged Corn with one count of felony child molestation in connection with the same alleged conduct.
