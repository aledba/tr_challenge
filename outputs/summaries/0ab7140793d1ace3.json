  "summary": "The Minnesota Department of Human Services today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing administrative proceeding against Kim Verhein, a Minnesota resident who was convicted of a drug-related felony.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Minneapolis, Verhumein, who was incarcerated for five years prior to her release from a correctional facility in 2001, was not eligible to receive MSA benefits because of her prior drug conviction. The SEC alleges that Verhoumein violated Section 256D.024 of the federal drug-testing rule by failing to submit to random drug testing as a condition of receiving benefits. The complaint further alleges that the SEC obtained a temporary restraining order halting Verheinein from participating in any MSA program. The court granted the SEC\u2019s request for an emergency order halting the administrative proceeding.  The SEC also issued an order temporarily suspending Verheumein from appearing for drug testing.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota today announced criminal charges against Verheein.  Verhoosein has agreed to settle the SEC action by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 16(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders her to pay a penalty equal to the amount of her disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On June 19, 2018, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Welshhans of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final order permanently enjoining her from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions. The final judgment also orders Verhoudei to pay $1,078 in restitution, which will be offset by a $100,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, VerHoumei agreed to a permanent injunction and to a five-year ineligibility period. The order also prohibits her from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  A hearing on June 20, 2018 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Schiff. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Minnesota Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Minnesota Office of Health and Human Services."
