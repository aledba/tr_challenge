  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered an order granting the Bankruptcy Court's request for an emergency asset freeze and other emergency relief.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that, on April 4, 2017, the Bank of America entered an Order granting the Court's motion for emergency relief and relief against Appellee and her husband, Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., in connection with the issuance of a Chapter 13 plan. According to the order, the Court granted the court's request to expedite the granting of emergency relief, including a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, and issued an order suspending the issuance, purchase, offer and offer of, and sale of the settlement funds. The court also granted the parties' motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Court also denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's order, for a final judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating Section 522 of the Exchange Act and orders them to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $8,632.85 (the settlement funds) after the payment of litigation costs, and orders the parties to submit an amended bankruptcy plan within 14 days of the entry of those orders. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against the Defendants, charging them with violating Sections 522(a)(1) and (3) and 1325(b)(2) and with aiding and abetting violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 and Rule 15a-3 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a related administrative proceeding, the SEC filed an emergency action on June 19, 2017 against the trustee for the trustee's unsecured creditors, charging the trustee with violating Section 1325 and ordering the trustee to pay $22,500 in interest and a $632,435 civil penalty. The trustee has agreed to settle the case against her by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations, ordering her to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion by the trustee. The settlement funds are subject to court approval. The complaint also alleges that the trustee had the option of seeking leave of court to determine whether or not to apply for relief under the federal securities laws, including Section 13"
