  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against BMW of North America, BMW of Morristown, and Open Road of Edison, Inc., all of which are charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, BMW's built-in tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) is defective. The complaint alleges that, as a result of its failure to detect a significant loss of tire pressure, the TPMS can be reset at a low pressure level and thereby extinguish the warning telltale.  The complaint further alleges that Leiss failed to mention that, in addition to failing to mention the potential cause of the fire, Leiss did not mention that he had observed a \"black box\" on the dashboard of a BMW X3.  Leiss also allegedly failed to disclose that, when confronted by a passing truck driver, he replied, \"No, that's not true.\"  The SEC's order against BMW, BMW, and open road defendants requires the court to determine whether or not to impose a civil injunctive action against Leiss.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, BMW consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Rymas and Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit, with assistance from Eric R. Werner of the Division of Enforcement's Analysis and Detection Center. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Police Department, and the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles."
