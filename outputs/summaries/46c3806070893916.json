  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) for improperly granting intervenor compensation to two intervenors, The Utility Reform Network (TURN) and the Center for Accessible Technology (CforAT), for their work in a complex telecommunications merger review proceeding dismissed by the CPUC as moot for reasons unrelated to anything that happened in the proceeding itself.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sacramento, California, the Commission improperly awarded TURN and CforAT compensation in connection with a proposed merger between AT&T and T-Mobile USA.  The complaint alleges that the Commission violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, TURN, the center for accessible technology, and TURN agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their compensation.  In a parallel action, the California Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against TURN.  TURN has agreed to settle the charges against it by consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and (3) and ordering TURN to comply with the agreed-upon settlement provisions of Section 5(b).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Enforcement's Public Finance Abuse Unit, with the assistance of the Division's Analysis and Detection Center, and is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Jennifer Chun Barry and supervised by Amy Gwiazda. The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the California Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Office of Financial Regulation.
