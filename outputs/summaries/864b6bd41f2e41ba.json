  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was found liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, alleges that defendant Kerry Hazelhurst, John Doherty, T.J. Coakley, Mark Richardson, Brian Donohue, Robert Turgeon, and Gregory Condon violated Section 1983 of the Exchange Act.  According to the complaint, Hazelhurst and Doherty falsely claimed that Cosenza was a \"familiar face\" when, in fact, he was a man who had no hair.  In fact, the complaint alleges that the defendant had been in an inpatient treatment program and had not been in contact with law enforcement.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity for their failure to intervene in a civil proceeding.  Instead, the SEC alleges that defendants used a series of false and misleading statements to convince M.H. that she had never seen her attacker before, and that the defendants had engaged in a pattern of conduct that led inexorably to the violation of her right to due process.  For example, according to the SEC, in 2011, a federal judge found that defendants violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose material facts about the alleged conduct of their officers.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC in the Complaint and the Court's Order, Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties.  On May 31, 2016, the court granted a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of the charged provisions of the Federal securities laws and ordered a preliminary injunction against further violations.  Separately, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Hazelhurst for his role in the alleged misconduct.  To learn more about pre-judgment injunctions, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-20 (January 24, 2018).  The U.K. Attorney's office for the Eastern District of Connecticut today announced parallel criminal charges in the case.  A federal judge has issued an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver, ordering the receiver to provide a copy of the complaint to the receiver.   The receiver has also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. "
