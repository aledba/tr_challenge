  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Maine today entered a final judgment against a father and mother seeking to terminate their parental rights to their child.  The court found that the father violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its order, the court also found that, contrary to the court's findings, the father had failed to act promptly to prevent the breakup of the Indian family.  According to the order, in addition to denying the father's motion to transfer the child to a tribal court, the federal district court for the Southern District of New York issued a temporary restraining order against the father and ordered him to return to the reservation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the judge also ordered the father to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On May 31, 2018, the final judgment, which was entered by the court, permanently enjoins the father from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and orders him to pay $7,500 in disgorgment, $1,038 in prejudgment interests, and a $100,000 civil penalty. The court also granted the father an emergency court order temporarily restraining him from participating in any proceeding related to the termination of his parental rights, including a hearing scheduled for June 14, 2018.
