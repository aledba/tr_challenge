  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Wisconsin today announced criminal charges against a Wisconsin man accused of stealing oxycodone pills.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Fond du Lac County, Wis., alleges that Michael Brantner, a resident of Kenosha County, Wisconsin, unlawfully obtained the pills in his boot.  According to the complaint, while in the process of recovering the pills from his brother, he discovered that the pills were in the boot of a car.  As alleged in the complaint:    The complaint alleges that, upon his arrest in Kenoac County, the state obtained a temporary restraining order, which temporarily halted his possession of the pills and allowed him to return the stolen pills to his brother.   In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Brrantner that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing a $10,000 civil penalty against him.  In its final judgment, the court also permanently enjoined him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, including, without limitation, the issuance of a civil injunctive relief, a penny stock bar, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  It also ordered him to surrender his passport, which he did not do, and that he would be barred from the securities industry for the rest of his life. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Wisconsin Department of Justice, and the Wisconsin State Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
