  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments in favor of John S. Turner and Dixie Inn Junction, L.L.C., against Turner and the Hoffoss Family.  According to the court's order, Turner and his family violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that Turner failed to fulfill his obligations under the joint venture provisions of the federal securities laws.  In its judgment, the court found that the defendants did not have a duty to comply with the agreed-upon obligations of the parties and that Turner was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law for the purposes of executing the project.  Turner also was not entitled to an attorney-client relationship with any parties involved.  As set forth in the court order, the defendants failed to show sufficient evidence to support their claims that the parties had violated the obligations and that they had no interest in executing the casino and truck stop.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Turner, Gail Kinnaird, Donna Suman Hoffoss, and Self Service Gas, Inc. (\u201cHoffoss Family\u201d) have each consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the securities laws, order Turner to pay disgorgement of $1.2 million in prejudgment interest, and order him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Additionally, Turner has not agreed to be enjoined from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the public company.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Amy C. Mascianica of the United States District Court in New Orleans entered a final judgment against Turner, ordering Turner to disgorge $1,2 million of ill-gotten gains plus interest, ordering the sale of the property, and ordering the seizure and sale of all of the properties at issue.  To settle the case, Turner agreed to a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to repay $1 million of the $150,000 owed to him by the defendants in a civil proceeding.   The judgment also prohibits Turner from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in a joint venture and orders Turner to repay the $250,000 he owes by the time he is due to be sentenced in a court hearing on May 24, 2019.
