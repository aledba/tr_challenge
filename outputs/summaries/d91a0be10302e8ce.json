  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Barry Davis, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 216 months in prison for his role in a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Davis violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to adequately disclose to the court that Davis had been convicted of engaging in the conduct of three adult women, A.Z., T.B., and C.D., who were also victims of the same conduct.  According to the complaint, Davis was not provided with adequate notice of the victim statements presented at the sentencing hearing.  Davis also allegedly did not respond to the government's requests for a copy of the plea agreement, despite repeated requests from the court.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Davis, charging him with violating Section 15(a)(1) and (b)(2) of Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of 240 months.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Davis consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposes a $1,000 civil penalty against him.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Sansone of the U.N. Division of Criminal Justice issued an order suspending Davis from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney.  Judge Sansone's order also prohibits Davis from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply as a judge upon motion of the court upon his motion for a hearing or motion of motion by the court on May 3, 2019.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (January 24, 2019).  The Court also granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order against Davis and ordered him to sign a release agreement that provides for him to return to the United Kingdom after a five-year period of supervised release.
