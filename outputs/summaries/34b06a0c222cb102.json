  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama yesterday entered a final judgment against Surgicare of Mobile, Inc., a publicly-traded medical equipment manufacturer, and its owner, Providence Health System, Inc. (\"Providence\"), in a parallel action.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on April 20, 2016, in Montgomery County, Alabama, the hospitals allege that the Alabama Department of Health Planning and Development (SHPDA) improperly excluded depreciation from its $980,000 projection of new annual operating costs.  The hospitals also allege that, in violation of generally accepted accounting principles, the state did not consider depreciation as an operating expense when it issued its request for an LNR for the ASC in August 2014.  As alleged in the complaint, however, this was not true, and the hospitals' complaint was filed on the same day that SHPDA issued its decision denying their request for a LNR.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the hospitals failed to adequately disclose that depreciation is a real expense that results from a capital expenditure under the federal tax laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the hospitals, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  Finally, the hospital's attorney, Michael Gosney, has agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  He also agreed to be permanently barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and to pay a civil penalty of $1,102,881, which is equal to the amount of his or her salary.  On May 24, 2017, the SEC issued an order requiring the hospitals to submit an application for a declaratory judgment in which it determined that depreciation was not an expense under the state's tax laws and that it should be excluded from the calculation of \"operating costs\" as set forth in the Commission's Rules of Practice.  Additionally, the court issued a temporary restraining order against the hospitals from further violating the above-mentioned provisions of the Commission Act, ordering them to submit written and oral testimony in support of their motion for a judgment against the defendants.
