  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment against James Ross of Vicksburg, Mississippi, ordering him to serve three concurrent thirty-year terms in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections for the sexual battery and statutory rape convictions.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi on January 5, 2018, Ross pleaded guilty to three counts of child neglect and one count of statutory rape in violation of the federal securities laws.  The SEC alleges that the jury was informed that Ross had left Johnson because he disagreed with how Johnson was handling his children.  As alleged in the complaint, Ross agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to a five-year bar from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged crimes.  Ross also agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 97-3-95(1)(d) and the securities registration provisions of Sections 9(a)(1)(A) and 9(b)(2)(B) and to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Ross.  On January 6, 2018 the U. S. District Judge in Jackson issued a temporary restraining order against Ross and ordered him to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the SEC allegations, Ross consented to the issuance of the order permanently enjoining him from further violations of the charged provisions, and ordered that he pay a penalty of a total of $250,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a $50,000 civil penalty.  He also agreed not to be associated with any SEC-related entity, including the Department of Justice, in the future, with an officer or director of a public agency.  A hearing scheduled for February 21, 2019, was scheduled for 5:30 p.m. for Ross and his attorney, Stacy Rollison, to present the evidence presented at trial.  To learn more about child neglect, see Litigation Release No. 522 (Rev. 2014).  The case was supervised by Scott Frost, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office.  An SEC examination that led to the examination of the evidence was conducted by John R. Rymas of the Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit, with assistance from Scott Frost."
