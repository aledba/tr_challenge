  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a California man accused of engaging in a long-running human trafficking scheme.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Santa Ana, California, alleges that, from at least 2009 through at least 2013, defendant Christopher R. \"Christopher\" Yolanda used his entire body to rape a woman in the back seat of a car. The complaint further alleges that YOLanda told defendant that she did not want to have sex with the john and that she would rather have him do it by force than by means of force. The SEC alleges that defendant agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the court should have instructed the jury on whether to run counts 3 and 5, and 4 and 6, concurrently. In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendant did not tell the woman that he had a gun and that he was going to use it to commit a felony. The court also ruled that defendant could not be liable for the same amount of time that he spent with the victim.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars him from participating in any future offering of a penny stock. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-20-2014.  On May 26, 2018, the Honorable Judge David J. Burt of the U. S. District court for the Northern District of Florida entered a judgment against Christopher Yolandowsky, ordering him to be enjoined and ordered to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2,038, and a $100,000 civil penalty. The final judgment also orders Yolantowsky to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and ordered her to be restrained and restrained from associating with any person who is not a member of the public. The jury deliberated for two hours before finding Christopher guilty on all of the charges. The judgment against Yolandi was entered by Judge Burt on May 24, 2018. The Court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against future violations."
