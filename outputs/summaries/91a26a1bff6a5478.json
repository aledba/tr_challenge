  "summary": "On March 21, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio entered a final judgment against Daniel C. Cadle, the controlling stockholder/president of Health Grades, Inc., a publicly traded corporation that provides rating and consulting services for hospitals and physicians throughout the United States.  According to the court's order, on May 31, 2011, Mr. Hicks filed a complaint in federal court in Ohio alleging that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that, contrary to the SEC's findings, Hicks did not commit a serious act of extortion in connection with his filing of the complaint.  In addition, the court found that the complaint was not a pre-emptive action and that, in fact, Hicks had engaged in a pattern of corrupt conduct, including, without limitation, verbal and physical abuse of the right to a penny stock and an attempt to obtain a judgment against him in violation of Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 12a-1, 12b2-2, and 13a-13 thereunder, and that he failed to meet his reciprocal burden to prove the amount of fair, reasonable and necessary legal fees and expenses that he incurred in defending against the alleged conduct.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Hicks consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,250,000, plus prejudgment interest of $2,500, and orders Hicks to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  On March 24, 2020, a federal district court in Columbus, Ohio, entered a judgment ordering the issuance of a temporary restraining order against Hicks, ordering him to surrender his passport, and imposing a $10,000 civil penalty against him.  As part of the settlement, Hicks agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay $1.5 million in civil penalties.  Hicks also agreed to a $25,000 officer-and-director bar, which he agreed to.   The settlement is subject to court approval.
