The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Diego, California, alleges that, from at least October 2008 through January 2010, Nuneez and his cohorts engaged in a series of aggressive, unprovoked, and unprovable attacks on innocent victims of crime.  According to the complaint, the defendants were particularly aggressive in their aggressive, aggressive, and aggressive attacks on the victims.  In one instance, the complaint alleges that the defendants used a knife to stab a victim in the stomach and back, and the other injured a third victim.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal on June 28, 2010, the court found that, contrary to the stated intent of the defendants, the defendant was entitled to a reprieve, pardon, or commutation of his sentence.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission's Judgment, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and imposes a $25,000 civil penalty against each defendant, and requires them to submit written statements to the court to justify their actions.  On June 29, 2011, the Court granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to return to California, where they reside, to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $75,000 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay an officer and director bar in the amount of $100,000.  At a hearing on June 30, 2012, the Honorable Kathleen L. Gibson of the San Diego District Court entered a judgment against the defendants that permanently restrains the scope of the executive clemency provision of the California Constitution, and orders the parties to comply with the court's order.  A hearing scheduled for July 20, 2012 is scheduled for 11:30 a.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, the California Secretary of State's Office, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation."
