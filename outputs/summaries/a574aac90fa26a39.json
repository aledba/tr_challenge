  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Jacob Anthony Kessel, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for two prior felony drug-related convictions.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that Kessel violated the conditions of his community control (CLC) by failing to object to Judge O'Connell's imposing sentence.  According to the complaint, Kessel also failed to inform his probation officer that he had been arrested on February 27, 2015 for possession of drugs and failed to comply with a probation revocation hearing.  Kessel's sentencing was scheduled for May 2, 2018, and the court found that, based on the defendant's history, he was eligible for CLC based upon his lack of significant criminal history and the fact that he was incarcerated for a total of 355 days.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the CLC provisions of the federal criminal laws, including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Kessel arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On May 4, the court issued a temporary restraining order, ordering Kessel to surrender his passport, and ordering him to appear before the court for a hearing on May 9, 2018 to determine whether to issue a judgment imposing a permanent injunction against future violations of the relevant federal sentencing laws.   The court also issued a cease-and-desist order, imposing a $1,000 civil penalty, and appointing a receiver for Kessel.  A hearing for the receiver has been scheduled for April 24, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2018-2022, Litigation release No. 13, 2019-2023.  Separately, the SEC issued an order suspending Kessel from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, including securities in the securities of any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments in an investment in a business.\u00c2\u00a0"
