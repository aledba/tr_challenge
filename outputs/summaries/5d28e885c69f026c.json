  "summary": "On May 8, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Rhode Island entered a final judgment against a Providence, Rhode Island man who was convicted of felony assault with a dangerous weapon and sentenced to five years of probation.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on December 25, 2015, Luis Portillo (Portillo), while listening to music and having drinks with a group of friends in the basement apartment of a Providence apartment building, confronted defendant with a machete in his hand and told him to \"calm down.\" The complaint further alleges that defendant then asked Portillo to move his car because he was \"trying to keep the kids who were inside from going outside,\" and then demanded that the car be moved because he \"was going to call the police.\" Portillo allegedly refused to do so, and the three men followed him into the apartment building. As the defendants entered the building, Portillo's sister and two of her friends confronted him and demanded that he stop. The defendant allegedly kicked and kicked the sister and her friend out of the apartment, causing the sister to scream for help. The court ultimately granted the defendants' motion for a new trial, which was delayed until the SEC's case was handled by the agency's Office of Criminal Investigations. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Rhode Island State Attorney's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Providence Police Department, the Department of Justice, the FBI's Cyber Unit, the Massachusetts Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigations Division, the Boston Police Department's Homicide Task Force, the Connecticut Office of the Chief of the Market and the Boston Regional Office.
