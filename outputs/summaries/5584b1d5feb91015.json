  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against Charles Oliver for distributing child pornography.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Oliver violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Oliver, who was arrested in April 2017, used a peer-to-peer program to distribute child pornography to an undercover agent for the purpose of obtaining an \"expectation of receipt\" from the agent. Oliver allegedly sent the agent a picture of his own penis and asked for \"a pic or vid of the child.\" The complaint alleges that the agent replied that the picture was \"what I have for her\" and asked Oliver to \"put some stuff up soon.\"  The complaint further alleges that, by sending the image to the undercover agent, Oliver provided the agent with an email and Kik account that contained the message. The complaint charges Oliver with violating Section 5 of the Exchange Act and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Oliver has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $25,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Oliver has agreed to a five-level enhancement, which requires him to show that he has engaged in a reasonable anticipation or reasonable belief of receiving a thing of value from another person, and that he is prepared to comply with the court's order.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Oliver. The SEC is continuing its litigation against Oliver, and the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Police Department, the FBI, the U.N. Secret Service, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations Division, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Department of Justice, the Federal Housing Finance Corporation, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, the Ohio Department of Insurance, and other emergency relief."
