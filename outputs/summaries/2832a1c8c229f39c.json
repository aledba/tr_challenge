  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment in favor of a municipal tax assessor's motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing her assets, and ordering her to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $2,600.  According to the court's order, filed on July 29, 2016, Barbara J. Hertz filed a Farmland Assessment application for her property located at 77 Orchard Drive, Lincoln Park, New Jersey. The complaint alleges that she intentionally left most of the land unfarmed for agricultural or horticultural use, and instead used a tape measure and/or paced off the area to conceal the fact that she had not personally measured the land. The court also found that, contrary to the claims in the complaint, the property was not in a managed agricultural or agricultural use.  The court further found that the property is substantially unmanaged, with minimal designated areas where any potential farming may occur or has occurred.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the application, the court has agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey announced criminal charges against Hertz. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the New Jersey Office of Inspector General's Market Abuse Unit, and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Hovbilt. The case has been supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by David A. Kasper and supervised by Jan Folena of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The investigation was supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Enforcement Division's New Jersey Field Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.N.
