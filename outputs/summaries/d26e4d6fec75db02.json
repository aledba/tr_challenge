  "summary": "On November 9, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama entered a final judgment in favor of Hawkins in a civil injunctive action brought by the SEC against her.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, alleges that, on July 29, 2015, Hawkins was driving a Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck through a tunnel when she was hit by a car.  According to the complaint, Hawkins, who was driving the truck at the time of the accident, did not see or hear the impact of the collision.  Instead, the complaint alleges that she was in the middle of the tunnel when the car hit her, and that, as a result of her actions, she was unable to avoid the impact.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Hawkins' actions led her to conclude that she had been contributorily negligent and that her negligence was a proximate cause of the injury.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Hawkins consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of $50,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Hawkins also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Hawkins.  On November 21, 2019, the court granted Hawkins's motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered her to return to her home to be enjoined from further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17a-1 thereunder. The court also ordered Hawkins to comply with the bar against her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of the company or prohibiting her from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, or nationally recognized statistical statistical rating organization.  To settle the case, Hawkins agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations, to be permanently barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and to a five-year officer-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  Among other things, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Alabama State Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Alabama Department of Health and Human Services."
