  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a defendant for his role in a drug-trafficking conspiracy.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, by executing a generic appeal waiver, the defendant relinquished his right to counsel at sentencing on the basis that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in agreeing to the waiver.  According to the complaint, the generic waiver does not preclude a defendant from appealing his or her sentence. Rather, the complaint alleges that a defendant can raise a colorable claim for ineffective assistance at sentencing by simply stating that his attorney provided him constitutionally ineffective assistance.  In addition, the SEC alleges that defendants can raise the issue of whether a defendant has received constitutionally ineffective counsel at trial by citing the fact that the district court imposed a downward variance from the sentencing guidelines range, or by requiring the defendant to provide timely assistance in identifying any sentencing error and obviating any need for an appeal.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 566-31, July 17, 2018.  On August 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge William J. Burt of the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of California granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the issuance of a court order temporarily restraining the defendants from violating these provisions. The court granted the request for an emergency court order and issued an order temporarily suspending the suspension of certain defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of a case-by-case review. The SEC is continuing its litigation against the defendants.  This case is being handled by John Wesley Hall, Jr., Chief of the SEC Division of Criminal Justice, and Amy Gwiazda of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Hall and Ms. Hall, and the case will be supervised by Jennifer C. Barry."
