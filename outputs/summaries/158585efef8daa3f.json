  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against Madonna Benson, a California-based attorney, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 581b of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The SEC's complaint, filed on December 7, 2017, alleges that, on September 3, 2012, defendant executed a promissory note to pay $15,000 plus interest to plaintiff, and on August 13, 2018, she executed a second promissorial note to repay the costs and fees.  According to the complaint, this action was subject to dismissal because the court granted the motion to dismiss, without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, that the motion was granted without prejudice to the facts of the matter.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Benson.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, Benson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay disgorgement of $22,529.64 plus interest, costs of the suit and attorney's fees under the terms of the notes, and to pay a civil penalty of $8,000.  Benson also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar prohibiting her from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in any offering of a penny stock or offering of any penny stock.  On December 13, 2019, the court issued a minute order suspending Benson from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and ordering her to comply with the court's order.  After the court ruled against her, Benson filed a motion to transfer from Los Angeles to Ventura County, where she resided at the time she filed the motion, which was filed under seal. The court denied the motion and ordered Benson to pay the civil penalty, which is subject to court approval. The SEC complaint charges Benson with violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations. The complaint also seeks a temporary restraining order against Benson, an order requiring her to return her allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, and a penalty from the SEC.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of the United States District Judge in the Los Angeles Regional Office, and the case was supervised by Assistant Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Robert A. Kasper and supervised by Amy C. Barry."
