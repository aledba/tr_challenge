The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Hampshire, alleges that on May 30, 2014, the defendant sent an e-mail to a friend with the subject line, \"The coming months of slaypril and slay,\" inviting her to spend time with him. The defendant allegedly told the friend that he wanted to \"pork\" the victim \"more than anyone\" and asked her to put in a good word for him. According to the complaint, the friend replied that he \"just pulled every trick in the book,\" including oral sex. The complaint further alleges that the defendant replied, \"Praise Jesus, I put on a kind of crush on the victim.\u201d The complaint charges the defendant with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.
