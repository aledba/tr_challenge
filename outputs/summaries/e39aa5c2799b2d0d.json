  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Colorado today entered final judgments in favor of a defendant who was convicted of two felony charges in connection with the alleged theft of a truck, motorcycle, and other personal property from a Conejos County farm.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Denver, Colorado, Nathan Richard Vigil was charged with first-degree aggravated motor vehicle theft, second-degree burglary, theft, and attempt to commit second degree felony.  The court found that the defendant had a right to a fair and impartial jury based on his prior experience with farm equipment and knowledge of farm equipment.  In addition, the court ruled that a defendant could evaluate the victim's testimony \"just like all the other witnesses who will testify.\"  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Vigil for his role in the alleged scheme.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Vigil consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public agency or the public defender's office.   The SEC's order also prohibits the defendant from participating in any jury selection or selection process, including the selection of a jury.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-1. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people who are preparing to participate in jury selection by using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the Court of Appeals today issued an order requiring the trial court to determine whether a defendant is entitled to a jury trial based on the qualifications of a juror, whether he or she is qualified to participate as an impartial jury, and whether a jury selection order requires the defendant to show cause why he should not be excluded from the jury selection process.  This order also requires the court to consider whether the defendant is qualified as an expert and whether he has a fiduciary relationship with the victim or a law enforcement agency that requires him to render an impartial verdict.  Among other things, the order requires that the jury consider the merits of the defendant before making a judgment."
