  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment in favor of The Alibi Restaurant Group, LLC, a Washington, D.C.-based restaurant chain, and its owner, Jack Davis, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed on July 19, 2017, alleges that, in January 2015, the District Court entered a temporary restraining order against the restaurant chain from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court found that, contrary to the Commission's findings, the Alibi restaurant was not aggrieved by the Board\u2019s decision to impose a $4,000 civil penalty on the restaurant. The complaint also alleges that the Board improperly imposed a $6,500 fine on Scahill in response to complaints that he had shown an injury-in-fact as a result of the Board's enforcement action. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court held that the defendants had violated the First and Fifth Amendment rights of the federal securities laws. The Court also ruled that the Commission had jurisdiction over all of the violations of the First Amendment, including, without limitation, the right to a fair and equitable treatment of the defendants.  In its judgment, the Court also ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $2,500, and ordered them to pay civil penalties of $1,500 each. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On August 2, 2018, the SEC filed a second amended complaint, this time against Davis, alleging that, based on his First Amendment rights, the Commission violated his First and Second Amendment rights. The SEC previously issued an order requiring defendants to show cause why they should not be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The Commission's order also requires defendants to demonstrate that they have reasonable cause to believe that they are entitled to a reasonable and fair hearing.  According to the SEC's order, filed in federal court on July 18, 2015, Davis and his father, Richard Traverso, were identified as co-owners of the restaurant when the Board issued the first complaint, and the second complaint was filed nine months after the original complaint. The third amended complaint alleges that Davis was not a part owner of the previous restaurant at the time the Commission issued its first order, and that he was not present at the restaurant on June 10, 2016, when it issued the second order. The District Court also found that in retaliation for exercise of HRH's First Amendment right, the Board should have applied the curable defect exception to issue preclusion to HRH Services"
