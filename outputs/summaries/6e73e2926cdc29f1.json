  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Colorado today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, from April 2012 through September 2016, Flamingo West, Ltd. failed to pay rent on time or in full for office space it was leasing in Aurora, Colorado.  According to the complaint, Mr. Bronchick raised the issue of whether or not the district court had sufficient evidence to find and reasonably calculate the amount of unpaid rent and fees, and whether the court should have held him personally liable for the breach.  In its judgment, the court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments that permanently restrains and enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amounts of their profits.   The court also ordered the defendants to cooperate with the SEC in its investigation of the matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
