  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the injured worker's compensation claim against Eberl's Claim Service, Inc., a property damage adjuster based in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver on May 5, 2016, an injured worker who sustained injuries from falling off a roof in June 2014 received medical care from Dr. Anjmun Sharma, an ATP. The complaint alleges that Dr. Sharma recommended that claimant request a one-time change of physician, which would automatically terminate her relationship with Dr. Miller. The SEC alleges that, contrary to this recommendation, the amendment did not apply to all changes of physician. Rather, the complaint alleges, the amended provision applied only to transactions taking place after the date of the injury.  The complaint further alleges that when a claimant sought to change her physician, her first physician recommended that she request a \"one-time\" change in physician. The amended provision, however, does not apply retroactively to a request to change a physician made before the effective date of that change.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Eberls has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a related administrative proceeding, the SEC instituted a hearing on May 6, 2016. The hearing was conducted in the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations, with the assistance of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Berges. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Colorado Office of Inspector General, and the Colorado Department of Insurance."
