  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Terrace L. Solomon and Wendy D. Barnes (formerly Solomon) in a custody case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Terrace and Wendy were married in 1999 and had four children during the marriage. Terrace was arrested and held in a United States Army prison outside Alaska. The court found that Terrace had broken down the door to their son's bedroom while the boy was inside, \"punched \" holes\" in the walls\" of their home, and attempted to contact Terrace's mother and fianc\u00e9e during the time he was incarcerated. In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York announced that it would not further continue the custody trial. The SEC also announced that the court would not grant a continuance for Terrace.  The SEC's Complaint alleges that, contrary to the court's findings, the court did not deem Terrace competent to proceed with the custody case because he had a history of domestic violence.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the superior court violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17a-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars. The judgment also prohibits Terrace from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the conduct of his or her family, including securities laws violations, and prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Terrace agreed to the final judgment without admitting, denying, or denying his allegations, and agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations. The final judgment also orders Terrace to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and orders him to pay $75,000 in restitution.  On the same day the court granted Terrace a temporary restraining order against further violations of the securities laws, ordered him to return to the United States and pay a $50,000 civil penalty, and ordered a hearing on the matter. The hearing was conducted in the absence of any evidence concerning the alleged domestic violence, and the proceeding was conducted by Wendy and Terrace"
