  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a New York attorney who has been barred from representing clients in pending family court cases.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, from 2015 to 2018, the husband of a previous attorney represented him in two family court proceedings.  The complaint alleges that the husband told his attorney that he had \"personal and private conversations with the attorney regarding himself, his wife, and his child, his ex-wife, his finances and other matters too numerous to be disclosed\" to his prior counsel.  As alleged in the complaint, however, this was not true, and the husband never disclosed those conversations to his then-wife.  In fact, the complaint alleges, the wife's attorney told the husband that she did not know the details of those conversations and that she was not privy to them.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000 and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Finally, the court issued an order requiring the husband to provide a \"clear showing\" of his conflicts of interest, including that he did not violate the attorney-client privilege, and that he would be entitled to a hearing to determine whether to disqualify him from representing a party in a pending family proceeding.  On May 2, 2019, the Court of Appeals in Manhattan issued a temporary restraining order against the husband, barring him from participating in any future family court proceeding, and ordering him to provide an accounting of his assets and income in the event of a court order requiring him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interests, and to pay civil penalties of $150,000 each.  A hearing for the husband has been scheduled for May 24, 2019.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5-108 (January 24, 2020).  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Criminal Justice. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney's Office, the Federal Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the"
