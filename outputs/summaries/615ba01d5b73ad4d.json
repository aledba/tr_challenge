  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Kathy Woodburn for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered an order freezing Woodburn's assets and ordering her to pay a civil penalty of $30,788.87.  According to the court's order, Woodburn consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders her to disgorge her ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposes a five-year community control order against her.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Woodburn.  Woodburn has agreed to settle the charges against her by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of Sections 5(a)(1) and 5(c) and ordering Woodburn to pay restitution in the amount of $20,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Miami Regional Office and the case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio Department of Banking and Securities."
