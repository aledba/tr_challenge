  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon and his co-defendant for violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Akron, Ohio, alleges that Willie Benton and Armando Merida violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Benton violated Section 3553(a)(2).

On May 2, 2019, the SEC filed a complaint in the U.K. District court in the District of Columbia, seeking a permanent injunctive relief, an order to bar Benton from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any drug, including, without limitation, the purchase, sale, or purchase of a controlled substance, including crack cocaine, which Benton allegedly purchased from a different supplier and sold in an upstairs bedroom.  To settle the SEC case, the defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged sections of the federal laws, to pay civil penalties of 235 and 293 months, and from serving as officers or directors of any state-level criminal organization.  Finally, the judge agreed to the imposition of a permanent suspension of all but one of Benton's prior felony convictions.  As a result of the court's order, the"
