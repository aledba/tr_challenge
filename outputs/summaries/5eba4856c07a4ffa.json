  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered final consent judgments against John Kuhni & Sons, Inc., a Utah-based certified mail company, in a civil injunctive action brought by the Utah Labor Commission.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that Kuhni and his company violated the federal securities laws by failing to timely respond to the SEC\u2019s complaint.  According to the complaint, Kuhni was not properly served with notice of the violation when he received a copy of the Citation from FedEx, a delivery service that the SEC alleges is not required to provide notice of a citation.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the State did not properly serve Kuhni when it sent the Citation to Kuhni by certified mail, because the State sent it through FedEx rather than through the United States Postal Service.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the State and Kuhni consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and order Kuhni to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Kuhni has also agreed to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  On June 6, 2016, the Utah Court of Appeals issued an order suspending Kuhni from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and ordering him to surrender his passport, which he had obtained from the SEC in a related administrative proceeding.  As part of the settlement, the SEC agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal and state securities laws, to which Kuhni agreed to disgorge $5,000, and to pay an officer and director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 34A-6-303(1)(a).  The complaint also seeks a temporary restraining order, an injunction, and a conduct-based injunction, against further violations of Section 15(a)(1) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1, and against Kuhni for violating the federal, state, and local securities laws.  A hearing is scheduled for May 10, 2017, for which a hearing will be held on the matter of whether or not to impose a civil monetary penalty. The SEC is continuing its investigation, which is being conducted by Scott O'Hearon and Graham Loomis of the Salt Lake Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. O'Keefe."
