  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin today entered a final judgment against Dennis Franklin and Shane Sahm, who had their sentences enhanced pursuant to the federal Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) for burglary of locked rooms within a building.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Madison, Wis., on July 23, 2018, the Wisconsin legislature amended the state's burglary statute in 1955 to include alternative means of committing one element of the crime of burglary under \u00a7 943.10(1m)(a)-(f).  The SEC alleges that the amended statute created a single felony of burglary that a jury could not unanimously find.  The complaint further alleges that, based upon their previous Wisconsin burglary convictions, the defendants were classified as armed career criminals and sentenced to a mandatory minimum of 15 years in prison.  As alleged in the complaint, the amended state law does not provide for multiple ways of committing burglary, and instead requires a jury to find a defendant guilty of each of those crimes.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Franklin and Sahm.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, both defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay a penalty equal to the amount of their respective criminal convictions.  On July 24, 2018 the court granted a request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the SEC to conduct an examination of the relevant provisions of the federal securities laws, including the reporting provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0The Securities Act, and the books and records provision of Section 924(a)(2) and (3) thereunder. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Mr. Karpel of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit."
