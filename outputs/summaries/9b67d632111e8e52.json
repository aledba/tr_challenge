  "summary": "On September 12, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a final judgment against Endurance Assurance, Inc., a Florida-based insurance company, and its vice-president, Antonio Zoghbi, in a parallel action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that, in May 2017, Endurance and Mr. Zoggi conducted a Ponzi scheme from 2013 through 2017, stealing approximately $4.7 million of investor funds.  According to the complaint, the defendants agreed to settle the litigation without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  Instead, the complaint alleges that the defendants entered into a written settlement agreement with Endurance whereby they \"admitted liability for their unlawful actions and transferred their ill-gotten assets\" to Elite and Security, the broker that, according to the SEC, had procured the insurance policy.  In addition, the SEC alleges that in October 2017, Mr. and Ms.Zoggi filed a civil injunctive action against Endurance, alleging that they violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Endurance violated the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) and of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\") and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.    The complaint also alleges that Endurance failed to provide sufficient facts to justify its action against the defendants, and failed to comply with the SEC's requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the losses incurred by the defendants.  Finally, the court granted Endurance's request for a partial summary judgment against the parties, and ordered Endurance to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $4,724, which would be offset by Endurance's payment of a civil penalty of $100,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Gregory Haskin and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Miami Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation."
