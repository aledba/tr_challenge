  "summary": "On February 8, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Oceanus Insurance Company, Inc., a South Carolina-based insurance company, that permanently enjoins the company from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder, and orders the company to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that Oceanus and its owner, Raymond G. Farmer, violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Farmer was not a party to any of the provisions of the SEC's orders, and he was not required to defend the company's actions in court.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Farmer did not participate in the drafting of the final judgment, and neither he nor Oceanus agreed to the entry of a permanent injunction or to the payment of any civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Oceanus, Farmer, and the company consented to the final judgments, which permanently enjoin them from future violations of the federal and state securities laws, and require them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 or $20,000, respectively. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Farmer, charging him with violations of Section 15(a)(1) and 15(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1, and aiding and abetting Oceanus' violations of Rule 15a-1.  On March 20, 2018 the Honorable Judge Gerald R. Mascianica of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering Oceanus to pay a civil penalty of $150,000 and a $50,000 civil penalty, and ordered Farmer to serve as an officer and director of the company.  A hearing scheduled for March 21, 2018 is being conducted by Michael V. Coccoma, Assistant Chief Administrative Judge for the Eastern District of South Carolina, and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans, Chief of the Division of Insurance, Criminal Division, and Division of Banking Regulation."
