  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against a Florida-based insurance company for bad faith insurance practices.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that State Farm Florida Insurance Company violated the antifraud provisions of Section 624.155 of the federal insurance law.  According to the complaint, the federal district court for the southern district of Florida issued a temporary restraining order on August 27, 2014, freezing the company's assets and ordering it to pay $65,000 in prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an attorney's fee.  In its order, the court found that the company violated the federal securities laws by failing to timely and properly investigate the claims, adjust the claim, and make a final determination of the insurer's liability and damages.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, State Farm agreed to settle the case by paying a civil remedy, which was the \"functional equivalent of a determination of liability\" required by the federal law. The court also ruled that the payment of the civil remedies by the insurer constitutes a \"key\" to resolving and paying a bad faith claim.  For example, the SEC previously ruled that an insurer cannot escape liability under bad faith statute by belatedly paying policy limits after sixty-day cure period has expired, and to hold otherwise would render portion of statute requiring damages to be paid within 60 days meaningless).  The court's order against the Demases, who are seeking a permanent injunction, permanently enjoins them from future violations of these provisions, and orders the company to pay a penalty equal to the amount of the insured's ill-gotten gains plus interest.  On August 26, 2014 the court granted the Demase's request for a preliminary injunction, ordered an accounting, and issued an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to proceed with a civil action against the company.  A receiver will be appointed by the receiver upon motion of the court upon request of the receiver.  An SEC investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay in the Miami Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Florida Department of Financial Services, and the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
