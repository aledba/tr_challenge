  "summary": "On December 8, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Orleans entered a final judgment against Michael Vales, the former Assessor of Orleans Parish, and his company, Mirabeau Family Learning Center, Inc., in a civil action brought by the city.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Orleans, alleges that, in 1995, Vales and his companies purchased and operated Filmore Parc Apartments II, an apartment building located on privately-owned property in Madison Parish, New Orleans. The complaint alleges that Filmore and his entities violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the property was not exempt from ad valorem taxes.  According to the complaint, the complaint further alleges that in 2014, Filmore, through its entities, entered into a lease agreement with HANO, which required the units to be dedicated and open to the public, for the purpose of providing \"workforce housing\" to low-income and extremely low income residents. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA) issued an investor alert alerting investors to the dangers of investment fraud.  OIEA's investor alert also warned investors to be aware of the potential for fraud and to be cautious of any investment that may be made in the project.  Investors should check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint alleges that Vales violated Section 15(a) and 16(a)(1) and Rule 16a-3 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.   The complaint also seeks a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against Vales.  Vales consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $61,755.92 civil penalty in the amount of $1,575,000.00.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the Assessor agreed to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged provisions, ordering him to disgorge $1.5 million in prejudgment interests, and to pay civil penalties of $160,000 and $75,000, respectively.
