  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a defendant who agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, alleges that defendant was falsely told by the prosecution that he had suffered a prior serious felony conviction for manufacturing hash oil, was a felon in possession of a firearm, and had a prior felony conviction.
