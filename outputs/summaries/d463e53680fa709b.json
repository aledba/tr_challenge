  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against a Lexington, Kentucky man who was convicted of first-degree robbery and fixed punishment for that crime at twenty years' imprisonment.  According to the SEC's complaint, on February 7, 2007, a man later identified as Appellant Christopher Gamble walked into the Alexandria Drive branch of Chase Bank in Lexington with his head and face covered and demanded money from the teller. The complaint alleges that the defendant in question, Christopher Gamble, made a series of aggressive and threatening statements in his opening and closing statements, including one suggesting that he had a gun.  The complaint further alleges that, in the course of writing these statements, the defendant raised the issue of whether or not to disqualify his second attorney, who was also a co-counsel at the time of the alleged robbery.  As alleged in the complaint, the trial court denied Lang\u2019s motion for a directed verdict and instead ordered him to write out his closing argument before commencement of the trial.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Lang consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Lang arising from the same conduct.  On May 9, 2017, the court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered Lang to return to the federal district court for a hearing on June 21, 2017 to determine whether to proceed with the criminal case against him.   The SEC complaint charges Lang with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(2) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar against Lang. The SEC's investigation was conducted by David J. Kerstetter and Glenn S. Gordon of the Atlanta Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Timothy J. Conrrad. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kentucky Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the Kentucky State Corporation Commission, the FBI, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office."
