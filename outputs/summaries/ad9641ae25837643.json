  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who challenged a probation condition that required him to submit to warrantless searches of his electronic devices, including any electronic accounts that could be accessed through these searches.  The court also found that the probation condition imposed on Ricardo violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, Ricardo, along with two adult cousins, committed two felony burglaries in San Jose earlier that year.  As alleged in the complaint, Ricardo had told a probation officer that he wasn\u2019t thinking when he committed the crime and that he stopped smoking marijuana after his arrest because he felt that it did not allow him to think clearly.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Ricardo.

The SEC complaint charges Ricardo with violating Sections 5 and 5 of the federal securities laws, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgements, and civil penalties.  It also seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an order requiring him to surrender any electronic devices or records he has, including his cell phone, to a court-appointed receiver.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendant, charging him with violating Section 15(a)(1) and (3) and Section 17-a-3 of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b-3 thereunder, and Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206 of 1940, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0Securities Act, and Rules 206(3)-8, 206 (4) and 207(4)-8 thereunder against Ricardo, ordering him to comply with the"
