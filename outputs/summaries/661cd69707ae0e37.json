The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Hartford, Connecticut, alleges that, on January 9, 2009, Douglas Lee and four co-defendants set up a drug transaction where Teasley would buy cocaine from Lee.  According to the complaint, Lee and the others set up the drug deal with Teasley and when Teasley arrived at the specified location, he was ambushed by Cook, Mickens, Hunter, and Ashanti, who kidnapped Teasley by binding his hands and forcing him into the back of his car.

Judge Burns also granted Lee's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 and Rule 15a-3 thereunder, ordering Lee to surrender to the court upon his motion for an injunction, ordering him to comply with the court's order.
