  "summary": "On June 17, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in a civil injunctive action brought by the victims of the Charleston, South Carolina, church shooting.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that the FBI violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the FBI's discretionary function exception prohibits certain individuals from purchasing or possessing a firearm, including those who have been convicted of a felony or are currently prohibited by federal law from purchasing a firearm.  For example, the complaint alleges that, in the course of conducting the background check, Roof had been arrested not on a felony drug charge but on a misdemeanor charge for simple possession of a Schedule III controlled substance without a prescription.  In its judgment, the court held that the federal government was immune from liability for negligently performing the Roof background check because it had no jurisdiction to determine whether a person was liable under the mandatory function exception.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal, state, and local laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Birkenheier and Glenn S. Gordon of the Boston Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of South Carolina in this matter."
