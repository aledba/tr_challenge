  "summary": "On March 24, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Matthew Avitabile, a resident of Schoharie County, New York, who is seeking a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, on March 22, 2016, Avitiabile filed a complaint in the United States District Court in Manhattan against New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, alleging that Schneiderman violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint also alleges that the District Attorney violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in violation of Section 5(b), Schneiderman failed to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of his claim for relief under Rule 5b-6.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Schneiderman consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 5 of the Exchange Act and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  On March 26, 2017 the court granted the SEC and Schneiderman's motion for summary judgment, ordering the SEC to pay civil penalties of $150,000 each.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael Kachalsky and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
