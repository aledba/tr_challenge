The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that Wilson made a series of false statements to a jury during the course of the trial, including that he had engaged in a \"jealous lover\" defense, that he was prepared to kill a woman, and that he would \"handle shit on my own.\"  Wilson also allegedly told the jury that, during a verbal altercation leading up to the stabbing, he had \"jumped in the car with me as if [he] was going to hurt me.\"  According to the complaint, Wilson replied to one of the jury members by saying, \u201cI gotta think of a good reason as to why my life was in danger.\u201d  The complaint further alleges that, when Wilson returned to the house for a visit, he told another woman that he \"was excited about having a baby in the same way.\"  In addition, Wilson allegedly told one of his co-defendants that, if he didn\u2019t get his way, the baby would be different because he would have had somewhere more permanent to lay his head for nine months.
