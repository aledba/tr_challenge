  "summary": "On January 25, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Orleans entered a final judgment against Roxann Franklin Alexander, Sr., a Harvey, Louisiana resident, and her co-defendant, Michael Anthony Alexander, III, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on June 28, 2018, Alexander and Roxann filed a motion to vacate default judgment against Bank of America, which was confirmed by the court the same day.  The complaint alleges that Alexander failed to show that he was prevented or excused from asserting his defenses and that the default judgment was void because it was entered against only one defendant, Roxann Alexander, when more than one defendant was sued in the same case.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that the court did not err in denying Alexander's motion for vacate without a hearing, and instead denied his motion for return of his allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty.    The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the New Orleans Regional Office and the case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
