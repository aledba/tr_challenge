  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment against Jeffrey Alan Bourassa, a Georgia resident who was convicted of possession of more than one ounce of marijuana, conspiracy to commit that crime, and violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The Court of Appeals also issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta on October 5, 2018, the court found that, in March 2013, when confronted by a law enforcement officer who had intercepted several phone calls between Bourassas and a man who identified himself as \u201cJ\u201d or \u201cJB,\u201d that neither he nor any phone number associated with him was a party to any of the intercepted calls. The court also ruled that, based on the evidence uncovered in the course of the investigation, the defendants could not establish standing by pointing to evidence that the government's wiretap targeted a person named \u201cPicho\u201d and by claiming that the person who was listening to the calls was his nickname.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to comply with the court's orders.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against BourAssa. The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Georgia Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Georgia Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
