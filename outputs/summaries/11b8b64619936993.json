  "summary": "On May 14, 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the King defendants, the Swartz daughters, and the corporate defendants in a civil injunctive action.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, Jerome Swartz and his daughters, Shanah Swartz Gordon and Nikola Swartz-Hennes, made materially false and misleading statements to the court in connection with the alleged fraudulent transfers of assets.  The SEC alleges that the defendants misappropriated more than $1.3 million in investor funds for personal expenses and to pay personal expenses.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Swartz, Gordon, and Hennes violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.  On May 16, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the New York District Court issued a temporary restraining order against the defendants and ordered them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay penny stock and officer-and-director bars.  At a hearing on May 18, Sansone agreed to the final judgments, which are subject to court approval, that the court will determine whether to impose a permanent injunction, impose a civil penalty, and issue an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receivership of the assets allegedly transferred to the Switz daughters. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Kasper and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Messrs. Klotzbach and Kasper. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority and the Financial Market Abuse Authority."
