  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Gregory Johnson and his company, ABM Janitorial Services-Midwest, LLC (ABM), for failing to disclose a potential personal injury claim related to a December 2010 automobile accident.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, Gregory Johnson was working as a security guard for Whelan Security of Illinois, Inc. (Whelan), at 30 North LaSalle Street, when he suffered a slip-and-fall in a stairwell while on patrol.  The complaint alleges that Gregory and ABM failed to disclose that they had been involved in an automobile accident, which could potentially result in a third-party action against other entities during the bankruptcy proceedings.  In addition, the complaint alleged that Gregory failed to file a workers' compensation claim when he was asked about it by the bankruptcy trustee, despite knowing of the injury and knowing that the trustee had abandoned the workers' comp claim.  As alleged in the complaint, Gregory's failure to disclose was a direct result of his failure to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their ill-gotten gains.  On August 1, 2016, the court granted a temporary restraining order against Gregory, ordering Gregory to surrender his passport, and ordering ABM to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Gregory agreed to the same monetary penalty as the court, and agreed to a permanent injunction against further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 10(d) the federal securities laws.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC's litigation will be led by Gregory and Ms. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Secretary of State's Office, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Illinois Attorney General's Office in this matter."
