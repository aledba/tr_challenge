  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Husein Habib, a co-defendant of Jean's, for orchestrating a fraudulent check-cashing scheme.  According to the SEC's complaint, from 2010 to 2014, Habib and Jean used Habib's company, Noor Enterprises of South Florida, LLC, to cash checks for Jean and Jean in return for a percentage of the value of the checks. The complaint alleges that Jean and Habib told Habib that they would use the checks to make payments to other people, and that Habib would cash the checks in the days leading up to tax season. Instead, as alleged in the complaint, Jean allegedly used falsified identification documents to conceal her involvement in the scheme, forged signatures, forged checks, and forged documents to make the checks appear legitimate. In addition, the complaint alleged that Jean was not authorized to cash checks and that she was unaware that she had forged signatures.  The complaint further alleges that, contrary to these representations, Jean continued to cashing checks even after Habib had told her that he would not do business with her because she was \"doubly penalized\" for the same conduct.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Jean. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and Eric R. Werner of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Schlegelmilch. The case is being supervised by Chedly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the U.K. Secret Service in this matter."
