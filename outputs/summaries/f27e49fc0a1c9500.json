  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma today entered a final judgment in favor of a trustee's motion to extend the deadline to object to Bressler's discharge.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Oklahoma City on March 6, 2019, filed by Carbon Investment Partners, LLC (Carbon) and its trustee, Lee A.Bressler, that the court granted the trustee's request for an extension of the deadline for filing an objection to a debtor's discharge of any prepetition debt under section 523(c) of the Bankruptcy Code.  The court found that the trustee had the ability to determine whether to grant an extension to the deadline, but failed to do so in a timely fashion.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Basingler.   The SEC's Complaint alleges that Basinger violated the antifraud provisions of Section 523 of the Code and Rule 4004(b)(2) and that he failed to follow-up and get a stipulation signed before the deadline expired.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of $16.8 million, prejudgment interest of $12.7 million, and a civil penalty of $2.5 million. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Eric R. Birkenheier and Glenn S. Gordon of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit in the Fort Worth Regional Office, with the assistance of the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations' Risk Analysis Unit's Analysis and Detection Center.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by John R. Rymas and supervised by Amy C. Barry. \u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
