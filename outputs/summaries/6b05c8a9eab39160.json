  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against convicted felon Xavier \"Tex\" Appellant of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in O'Fallon, Missouri, alleges that, on the evening of September 12, 2016, a group of five men and four women entered into a plea agreement to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, the defendants agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint and agreed to a permanent injunction, to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000.  In addition, the court granted the defendants' motion for a new trial, which was subject to court approval, to a temporary restraining order and to a conduct-based injunction prohibiting them from further engaging in the conduct of their respective criminal activities.  On May 24, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica granted the SEC's request for an emergency asset freeze and ordered the defendants to return to their respective states for a hearing on the matter.   The court also issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of a case-by-case review that was conducted by the Office of the Chief Justice of the United States and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Fleshner and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Department of Justice, the FBI, the Missouri State Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the FBI's Criminal Investigations Division in this matter."
