  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against Smithfield East Health Holdings, LLC d/b/a Gabriel Manor Assisted Living Center, a Johnston County assisted living center, and its attorney-in-fact, Sherry Tabor, finding that the defendants violated the fiduciary duty of the court by failing to adequately disclose the nature of an arbitration agreement presented to and signed by Ms. Hager.  The court also found that, contrary to the court\u2019s findings, the defendants failed to adequately represent that the parties to the arbitration agreement were not a party to the agreement.  According to the SEC, the court agreed with the court that the Defendants had a duty to arbitrate their claims against each other, and that they had the right to do so.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of an order that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Charlotte, North Carolina, charges the defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, penny stock bars, and officer-and-director bars. The complaint also names Saber Healthcare Holdings as a defendant in the case. The court granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order, and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (2014).
