  "summary": "On May 12, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of New Jersey entered a final judgment against Frankie N. Gonzales, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to a total of twenty-five years in prison for 14 felony carjacking and related crimes.  According to the court's order, Gonzales agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also ordered Gonzales to pay a civil penalty of ten years and ordered him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a $10,000 civil penalty.  Gonzales consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal district court in New Jersey.  In its order, the court found Gonzales liable for violating the securities registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The SEC's order against Gonzales also imposed a five-year officer-and-director bar and a 10-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting Gonzales from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, including securities in exchange for a share of the proceeds of a public offering of a penny stock.  On May 13, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, charging Gonzales with violations of Section 206(3) and (4) of Section 13(b)(2) of Securities Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-1 thereunder, and seeking a permanent injunction against future violations of the securities laws, as well as a penalty for Gonzales' participation in the alleged scheme.   The Court also issued an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver's communications with the receiver.  To determine whether the receiver is to be believed, the receiver must determine whether it is reasonable to believe that the receiver has a reasonable chance of making a reasonable decision about whether or not to use the receiver at the time of the alleged crime.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (Aug. 24, 2015).  The Commission's Order to Appoint a Receiver for the Receiver of the Exchange Act of 1934 (\"ORA\") requires the receiver to provide a copy of the ORA to the receiver, and to provide the receiver with a receipt of the stolen penny stock"
