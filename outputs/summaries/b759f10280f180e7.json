  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was sentenced to two years in county jail for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, alleges that, on a night in August 2014, officers responded to a call for service outside a housing complex where a group of individuals were drinking and refusing to leave the area. According to the complaint, Bryant and his girlfriend, Lamaine Jones, were smoking marijuana in a parked car when the officers entered the car. The complaint further alleges that Bryant told the probation officer that he was \u201c[f]ucking with the wrong gangster,\u201d and that he stopped smoking marijuana after his arrest because he felt that the drug was not in itself criminal. The court ruled that the electronic search condition was invalid under Lent and that Bryant could not be relied upon to comply with the requirements of the probation order. The SEC also ruled that, in a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Bryant. The U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order suspending Bryant from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The Office of Compliance and Enforcement's Office of Cyber and Risk Analysis has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them advice on how to spot suspicious activity.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Los Angeles Police Department, and the California Department of Banking and Securities."
