  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Ohio Environmental Protection Agency Director John Schrenk, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that, on April 11, 2014, Schrenck submitted a letter to the director of the Ohio Department of Environmental Quality (\"DOE\") asserting that he had failed to meet minimum staffing requirements at two water supply and wastewater treatment facilities in Ohio.  According to the complaint, however, the DOE did not consider his time card records and instead merely relied on the log books to determine the length of time chlorine needed to be in contact with the water so that the chlorine could properly disinfect the water.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the OE&R&D&C&A&E&E;s complaint, the OEPA Board of Directors issued an order on May 4, 2014 requiring Schrenkowski to file an appropriate notice of appeal by September 2, 2015, or face dismissal for want of prosecution.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting the suspension.  On June 8, 2016, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, which is subject to approval by the court.  A hearing scheduled for August 9, 2015 is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Ohio Office of Inspector General in this matter.
