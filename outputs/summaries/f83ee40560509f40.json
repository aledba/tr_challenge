  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment ordering a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against Brian K. McInerney, his former wife, Susan J. Stone, and their children, Elise and Dru, in a personal injury action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Boston, alleges that Mc Inerney was involved in a motor vehicle accident in 2001, in which he sustained a severe traumatic brain injury.  According to the complaint, the defendants created a trust for Stone to protect her assets from creditors. The complaint alleges that the trust was self-settled because the trust property was not available to the trustee at the time of the accident.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Financial Regulation (OFI) today announced that it has issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the creation of a spendthrift trust that would protect the assets of the trust from creditors, including Stone's children.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the receiver was not entitled to a share of any assets in the trust, but rather to a percentage of the assets held by Stone.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the complaint and the court's order, Stone consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of $3,538,402.34, prejudgment interest of $538,400, and a civil penalty of $50,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Reiser and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry and Ms. Basinger. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office, and the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office in this matter."
