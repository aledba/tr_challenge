  "summary": "On April 23, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that, in 2006, John Johnson was granted pretrial bond by the Georgia Department of Justice, which granted him the right to a new trial. The complaint further alleges that Johnson was not entitled to bail pending an appeal by the State, and that, instead, he was entitled to a pre-trial bond based on his prior conviction for murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.  According to the complaint, Johnson was also entitled to an automatic entitlement to bail for virtually every felony except murder and to a mandatory five-year term for the firearms charge.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Johnson.  On April 24, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Johnson, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aiding and abetting Johnson's violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Johnson consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties.  Johnson has also agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see SEC v. Johnson, No. 5-7-5 (a) (c) (1), (2), (3), (4), and (4) thereunder. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Georgia Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Georgia Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's Investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background"
