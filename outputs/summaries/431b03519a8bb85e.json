  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendants in a fraud case brought by the New York Attorney General's Office.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, defendants falsely claimed that leases were free, a cost saving benefit, and cancelable at the end of the lease term. The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to disclose to lessees that the leases were not signed by the defendants, and that defendants did not receive complete copies of the leases.  In addition, defendants' affidavits allege that defendants signed false leases that did not comply with the agreed-upon obligations under the leases, and failed to provide any evidence to support their claims.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief, and ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits. The court also granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar.  On May 2, 2020, the court entered an order suspending the defendants from violating the securities laws and ordering them to pay civil penalties of $1.5 million, $2 million, and $100,000, respectively.  A hearing for the defendants is scheduled for May 24, 2020.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 13, No 17, No 13, and No. 17, and the complaint filed under seal on April 11, 2016. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Attorney's Office, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy and the Office of the Secretary of Justice's Retail Strategy Task Force.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and whether they have any background in any of the above-mentioned matters."
