  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the California Department of Human Resources against the state's Department of Health and Safety.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that, in 2008 and 2009, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger issued executive orders requiring the furloughs of state employees in positions related to hazardous waste remediation and management on military bases.  According to the complaint, these orders violated the single-subject rule, which prohibits the government from imposing \"permanent\" or \"substantive\" reductions in employee compensation.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the federal district court in Sacramento issued a temporary restraining order on the agency's use of employee vacation days, which, in effect, delayed or prevented the agency from implementing the proposed pay reductions.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal in the District of Columbia, California, the Department of Education and California Secretary of State's Office issued a cease-and-desist letter to employees who had been furloughed in violation of the single subject rule.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief in the amount of $1,000,000.  Additionally, the court issued an order temporarily restraining the defendants from further violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to comply with the court's order, and ordering the agency to pay a civil penalty of $2,500.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Marc Blau of the Los Angeles Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Office of Inspector General, and the California State Auditor's Office in this matter."
