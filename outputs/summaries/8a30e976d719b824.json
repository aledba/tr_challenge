  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against three Kansas residents who were convicted under the federal employment verification system for using a false Social Security number on tax-withholding forms.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, Kansas, Ramiro Garcia and Guadalupe Ochoa-Lara violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 5(d) thereunder of the federal securities laws.  The complaint alleges that Garcia violated the registration provision of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and that he violated Section 13(b)(5) and 13(a) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-3 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Garcia consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 13 of the exchange, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Garcia.
