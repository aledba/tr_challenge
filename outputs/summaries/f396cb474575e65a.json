  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against El Salvadoran immigrant Luis Alfredo Rivas Alfaro.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Buffalo, N.Y., alleges that on May 1, 2019, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order and ordered the release of the Central American citizen, Franklin W. Apricio-Villarto, from detention at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility.  According to the complaint, on May 2, 2018, an immigration officer stopped the car and questioned the driver, who admitted that he was born in El Salvador and lacked proper documentation, and that the BPA had the burden of proving that the detention was justified at a bond hearing.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Department today announced that it had obtained an emergency court order temporarily freezing the assets of the Mexican-American citizen.  On May 4, 2020, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary asset freeze and other emergency relief.  Separately, on August 24, 2019 and on August 26, 2019 the U.N. District Court for the Northern District of Texas issued an order suspending the detention of a Salvadoran citizen for a period of five years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $4,500, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a $10,000 officer-and-director bar.
