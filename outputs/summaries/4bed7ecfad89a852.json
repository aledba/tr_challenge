  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment in favor of Hillcrest Property, LLC, a Florida-based real estate development company, against Pasco County, Florida, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order appointing a receiver to oversee the development of the property.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in federal district court in Pasco, the Commission issued an order requiring the Commission to determine whether to issue a right-of-way dedication for the property under consideration by the Commission.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against HillCrest.   The SEC alleges that the Commission violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(2)(A) and (c) thereunder of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's order, Hillcrist has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the Commission from violating the charged provisions of the Commission, and orders the commission to pay $4.7 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Additionally, the court granted the Commission the right to appoint a receiver, which will determine the amount of the fee to be paid to the receiver, based on the jurisdiction of the District Court.  On August 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge David J. Burt of the U. S. District court for the Central District of New York granted the Court's motion for summary judgment, ordering the Commission and the receiver to pay a $2,500 civil penalty, and ordering the receiver and receiver to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest and pay civil penalties of $4,724,500. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission has agreed to a permanent injunction against further violations of the above-mentioned provisions, and to the appointment of a receiver under the supervision of a federal district judge. The Commission has also agreed to the issuance of an order imposing a $80,000 civil penalty.  To learn more about this matter, see Litigation Release No. 5:  The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Florida Department of Commerce, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Florida Office of Inspector General, and the Florida Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
