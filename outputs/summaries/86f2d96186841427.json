  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments in favor of Amy Nutter Price and Robert E. Mark in a civil action brought by the Sisters of the Holy Sepulchre.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Amy and her predecessors violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Amy brought a quiet title action in the form of a promissory note in the shape of a \"strawman transaction\" in which two sisters agreed to pay the difference between the value of their interest in the property and the amount owed by the other sister. The complaint further alleges that the sisters entered into the silent title action without having any evidence to show that the joint tenancy had been severed prior to Catherine\u2019s death. The SEC alleges that, at the time of the quiet title filing, neither of the sisters had any proof of a severance of the property, and neither of them had ever claimed to have done so.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for Utah today announced criminal charges against Amy and Mark for their roles in the alleged scheme.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $18,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $20,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Amy has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Mark has agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from participating in any offering of penny stock, and to pay civil penalties of $13,614.99 and $1.25 million, respectively.  Virginia and Mark have agreed to settle the case by consenting to permanent injunctions against further violations of the federal securities laws. The court also granted Amy the right to return the PNC stock that she held as security on the note. The settlements are subject to Court approval. The litigation against Amy will be led by Mark and Amy, and the case is being supervised by Amy N. Hodkin and Virginia S. Anderson of the Salt Lake Regional Office. The case has been supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Utah Division of Securities and Exchange Commission."
