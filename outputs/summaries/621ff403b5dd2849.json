  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of G.C.'s motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing her assets, and ordering her to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Alameda, California, alleges that, in 2014, a judge in Santa Clara County, California issued a final disposition order that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 702 of the federal securities laws. The court found that the judge had discretion to determine whether certain \"prior adjudications\" were misdemeanors or felonies, and that the failure to make the required section 702 declaration resulted in an unauthorized sentence.  According to the complaint, the court did not consider the nature of the alleged violations when it issued the final judgment.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against G. C. The SEC also announced that it was pursuing an emergency asset freeze and other emergency relief.  A hearing on March 13, 2015, was scheduled for 6:30 p.m. EST. The hearing was delayed by an hour and a half because the court had not reviewed the case.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint filed in the case, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 702, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and requiring him to pay civil penalties in the amount of $25,000 or less.  On March 20, 2016, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Alameda District Court granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze, and the court granted the request for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 9 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the court to consider the merits of the complaint.  To learn more about asset freeze relief, see Litigation Release Release No. 17-cv-17-11."
