The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina on April 14, 2015, alleges that Legacy Data Access, Inc., a private equity firm, and its former owner, James Yuhas, violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to pay the company's $256,500 civil penalty.
