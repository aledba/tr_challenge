  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment in favor of the Ohio Attorney General's Office's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sandusky, Ohio, alleges that defendant Julian L. Kiser violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to impose mandatory post-conviction control over an individual convicted of a felony.  According to the complaint, Kiser failed to impose a mandatory pre-judgment judgment on the November 6, 2015 sentence, which required him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  Kiser also failed to provide any reasonable basis for imposing a mandatory postrelease control over the individual.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the trial court in Kiser's case failed to determine whether the defendant was a major drug offender when it imposed the mandatory prerelease control on him.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar against him from participating in any type of criminal proceeding.  On September 25, 2017, the Ohio Court of Common Pleas granted the state's motion for a preliminary injunction against Kiser and ordered him to remain in jail in lieu of bond pending a hearing on the merits of the case.  Last week, the court issued a judgment ordering Kiser to comply with the court's order, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, impose a civil penalty, and pay an officer and director bar in the amount of $1,000,000.   The court also issued an order requiring the defendant to pay disgorgement of $2,078, which he did not pay, and imposing a $3,500 civil penalty against the defendant.  A hearing on September 29, 2017 was scheduled for 11:34 a.m. The court granted the motion for an emergency restraining order, ordered the defendant's release, and ordered the judge to send him to the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction to begin serving his sentence on September 30, 2017.  Finally, on September 22, 2017 the court ordered the release of an officer convicted of violating the federal bar against serving as a felon.  As set forth in the complaint filed in the SEC, the jury found Kiser guilty of violating Section 10"
