  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against twelve banks and their affiliates for breach of ERISA fiduciary duties.  The SEC's complaint, filed on August 24, 2016, alleges that, in violation of the federal securities laws, defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants engaged in manipulative trading in advance of a scheduled fixing window to artificially inflate the market price of the plan assets.  According to the complaint, defendants manipulated the market-moving customer orders to create the appearance of increased trading in and around the fixed rate.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants also engaged in unhampered discretion in setting the fixing rate, and, in the alternative, engaged in party-in-interest transactions that resulted in the loss or destruction of plan assets, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  For further information, see Litvak v. Bank of Am. Corp., No. 15 Civ. 4285 (2d Cir. 1999).  The complaint also alleges that the defendants violated ERISA's registration provisions, and that defendants failed to adequately demonstrate that they exercised sufficient control over the disposition of Plan assets to qualify as ERISA functional fiduciaries.  Specifically, the court found that defendants breached the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) and (a)(3) of Exchange Act Rules 5a-5 and (b)(2)(A) and 5b)(5) and Rules 5b2-1 and (c) thereunder, that defendants acted as unregistered brokers and did not have the requisite authority or discretion to determine the appropriate level of compensation for certain of the Plan assets. The court also ruled that defendants did not violate the registration provision of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan today announced criminal charges against the defendants.
