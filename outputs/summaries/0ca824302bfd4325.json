  "summary": "The Pulaski County District Attorney's Office today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting the termination of parental rights of Tiffany McLemore to her child, L.S. (DOB: 8\u201316\u20132015).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas, alleges that, on July 14, 2016, the Arkansas Department of Health and Human Services (DHS) filed a petition for an emergency custody and dependency-neglect order against her.  The complaint alleges that the court improperly relied on the caseworker's testimony regarding the child's placement in the home and failed to consider the potential harm that could result from her removal from the home.  In its order, the court also found that, contrary to the court's finding, McLemora had failed to participate in individual counseling, had not gone to any AA/NA meetings, and had not participated in in inpatient drug treatment.  According to the complaint, in addition to failing to comply with the case plan and court orders, the judge also deemed that she had not signed any documents advising her of DHS's goals or expectations for her safety.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's action, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar in the amount of $1,000,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Toni Hansberry and supervised by Spencer L. Bendell of the Fort Smith Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Hanauer and Ms. Hannan. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney for the Middle District of Arkansas, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Arkansas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
