  "summary": "On April 9, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered an order granting a temporary restraining order against Rabo AgriFinance, LLC (Rabo) from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b)(5) and (c) thereunder.  The court also issued an order temporarily restraining Rabo from acting as an unregistered trustee in a Chapter 11 case.  According to the court's order, Rabo filed a motion seeking derivative standing to prosecute claims on behalf of the bankruptcy estate related to the allegedly fraudulent transfer of titled vehicles and unauthorized use of cash collateral.  Rabo's motion, filed in federal court in Omaha, Nebraska, alleges that the court improperly granted the court the right to determine whether to grant derivative standing.  In its order, the court granted the defendants the right, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to apply for derivative standing under the agreed-upon settlement provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) and of the Bankruptcy Code, and to determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion by the parties.    The SEC's order also prohibits Rabo, Kip and Andrea Richards, from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with a bankruptcy proceeding. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's complaint charges Rabo with violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar.  It also seeks an order requiring Rabo to disgorge its allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay a civil penalty, and pay a penalty equal to the amount owed to the debtor or bankruptcy estate in the proposed settlement.  On June 5, 2020, the Court granted the SEC's request for an emergency court order granting Rabo derivative standing and to appoint a receiver to enforce certain of its claims against the estate pursuant to Section 5 of the Securities Act.  A hearing on June 6, 2020 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 565, 567, 566, 571, and 567 of the SEC.  Separately, the SEC announced that it had obtained an order appointing a receiver and appointing a trustee to oversee the estate's reorganization.  This order requires the receiver to show that it is a representative of the estate and that the trustee is competent to enforce these claims. "
