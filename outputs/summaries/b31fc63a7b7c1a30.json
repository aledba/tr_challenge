  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia today entered a final judgment against Joseph R. Ziegler, Jr., a former assistant United States Attorney, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Clay County, West Virginia, alleges that, on or about April 4, 2019, at or near Bomont, W.Va., defendant told a trial judge that he could get any state charges against him dropped because he was an AUSA or SAUSA.  According to the complaint, however, defendant did not raise the issue of mental competence until after the jury returned its guilty verdict.  Instead, the complaint alleges that defendant told the court that he would have the case moved because he knew that a reasonable finder of fact could accept a conclusion of a defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.    The complaint further alleges that the court did not require the defendant to demonstrate \"the necessity of the witness's presence for an adequate defense\" when, in fact, the jury did not have the requisite funds to do so.  In a parallel action, the United States Department of Justice today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action and obtained an emergency court order halting the proceedings.  On November 24, 2018, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered a hearing to determine whether to proceed with a new trial.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5:10-HC-2009-FL, May 24, 2013. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also check the background of anyone selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related case, the SEC filed an emergency action on November 26, 2013, which resulted in the issuance of an SEC order prohibiting the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the name of a federal district court, including the right to reapply as a defendant upon motion by the court upon motion of the SEC.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the SEC, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $10,000.
