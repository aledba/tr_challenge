  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Antonio Oliver, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to six months in prison for his role in an April 2017 domestic violence case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that Oliver, a resident of Lake Forest, Florida, made a series of unprovoked and unprovable violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Oliver was arrested in the hotel lobby on March 25, 2017, after receiving and recovering from a liver transplant and receiving dialysis, and was subsequently evicted from his hotel room.  As alleged, Oliver then confronted his sister-in-law, Susan Connors, and her husband, James Tabler, in the lobby of the hotel.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Oliver.  On May 24, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan entered a judgment against Oliver, ordering him to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Oliver consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, pay a civil penalty, and pay a penalty equal to the amount of his disgorgement.  Oliver also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, with the right to a jury trial to determine whether he is entitled to a penny-per-share of any compensation.  Additionally, Oliver agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar, which prohibits him from participating in any conduct that constitutes a reasonable expectation of privacy in a public place.  Finally, the court granted Oliver's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to return to his home state of Florida, where he lives with his wife, Sandra Connors.  Last week, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Oliver for his violations of Section 15(a)(1) of Exchange Act Section 10-b) and Rule 15b2-3 thereunder, and against Sandra for aiding and abetting Oliver's violations of Rule 15a-4 thereunder of the Exchange Act, Section 17(b)(2)(A) and Rules 17a-3(B) and (c) thereunder; and against Ivan Mitchell for violating Section 10"
