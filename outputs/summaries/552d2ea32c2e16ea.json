  "summary": "On January 8, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New Hampshire entered a final judgment in favor of the SEC's motion for summary judgment against the former managing attorney of RJBA, Richard J. Boudreau & Associates, LLC.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Woburn, Massachusetts, alleges that, from at least 2001 through 2013, Schlee and Stillman, LLC engaged in remedial due diligence to determine whether RJBA had reasonable due diligence due to potential employee employment claims.  According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that Schlee & Stillman engaged in this remedial diligence because it was concerned about RJBA's potential employment claims and, in negotiating the purchase of the company's assets, \"actively reached out to clients in an effort to avoid potential employee claims.\"  The complaint further alleges that the complaint was drafted by Schlee, Stillman's regional attorney, Robert O'Brien, and was signed and sworn to by Mitchell.  In a parallel action, the SEC today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Schlee&Stillman, alleging that it violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the Court granted the SEC and its investigation of the matter, with the assistance of the Division of Enforcement's Office of Inspector General, the Office of Compliance, and the Enforcement's Retail Strategy Task Force.   The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit in the New York Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson under the supervision of C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling them investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov website\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling investments using the Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly identify if they are professionals or individuals who are not registered professionals with the SEC."
