  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a contempt order against the New York City Department of Children's Services for failing to comply with court orders to place children in foster homes.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan on July 31, 2018, the Department of Health and Human Services (OHHS) and the Office of Inspector General (OIG) failed to provide timely and accurate information to Kenneth's family and friends regarding his treatment, care, and progress in recovering from brain injuries and spinal cord injuries.  The complaint alleges that Kenneth was placed in the care of Kenneth's mother and brother, Javion W. and Kenneth R. Warren W. when Kenneth was a baby.  As alleged in the complaint, Kenneth was never placed in a home with his mother or brother and was instead placed with his father and brother in a temporary home.  In addition, the complaint alleged that Kenneth suffered as a result of ACS's repeated failure to provide him with the services and assistance he needed, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and physical therapy.  Kenneth also suffered from severe and repeated physical and mental disabilities, including seizures, seizures, heart attacks, and seizures.    The SEC's Complaint against Kenneth alleges that ACS violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, ACS has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes civil penalties against Kenneth. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael D. Dehdan and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the SEC Enforcement Division's New York Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the OIG and OIG, and the UIG has provided assistance in this matter."
