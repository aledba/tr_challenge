  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Michael Miller for his role in the distribution of child pornography.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Monmouth County, New Jersey, alleges that, from 2010 to 2012, Miller was convicted of possessing and distributing over 900 images and videos of extremely young children performing prohibited sexual acts, including the rape, penetration, and sexual assault of an infant. Miller was also convicted of second-degree endangering the welfare of a child by disseminating child pornography through the use of peer-to-peer file-sharing programs.  According to the complaint, Miller used the programs to disseminate the images, which he described as \"fleeting and shadowy\" in nature.  Miller's possession and distribution of the child pornography, however, was not incidental to imminent distribution, as would be true of an agent of or go-between for a seller, but rather was in possession for a \"substantial period of time separate and apart from his possession merely incident to a particular imminent sale.\"  The complaint further alleges that Miller violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 13(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Miller consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, and from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of the Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order suspending Miller from appearing or practicing before the Commission on Child and Family Abuse, and ordering him to cooperate with the Commission's investigation.  On May 20, 2013, a federal district court in New Jersey returned an indictment against Miller charging Miller with fourth-degree criminal possession of child porn. The court found that Miller was liable for the same amount of time and amount of money that he had already been sentenced for, and that Miller had been convicted of third-degree child pornography in a previous criminal case. The Court also ordered Miller to pay restitution of $7,500, and ordered him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $1,500. The SEC also instituted an administrative proceeding against Miller"
