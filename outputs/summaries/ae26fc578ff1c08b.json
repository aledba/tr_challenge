  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against defendant Sean R. Vaughn, who was indicted on two counts of felony drug trafficking and one count of having weapons under disability.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, on February 26, 2002, Vaughn was indicted as a felon for having a prior felony drug conviction.  The complaint alleges that, in 2002, when he was indicted, Vaughn consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction today announced that it has obtained a temporary restraining order against Vaughn from violating the federal securities laws.  On March 2, 2018, the U. S. District Judge in the Western Division of Ohio entered a judgment against Vaughn, finding him liable for two felony drug-trafficking convictions and ordering him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Vaughn agreed to be permanently enjoined from serving any prison term and to a five-year officer-and-director bar, with the right to apply for a bar against him from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Ohio Office of Inspector General."
