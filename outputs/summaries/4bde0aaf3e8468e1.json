  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against the City of San Diego for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that the City improperly entered into an amended and restated lease for Belmont Park Associates, LLC, a San Diego-area amusement park, for a period of more than five years.  According to the complaint, the city improperly concluded that the Restated Lease was exempt from the requirements of the Exchange Act by failing to publish notice in the official newspaper, hold a public hearing and adopt an ordinance before entering into the amended Lease.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the City consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins the City from violating the above-mentioned provisions, and orders the City to pay a civil penalty of $25,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Symphony, which is alleged to have violated Section 15(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Sections 10(e) and 13(b)(5) and 14(a) and 15(c) thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the San Diego Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the California Office of Inspector General in this matter."
