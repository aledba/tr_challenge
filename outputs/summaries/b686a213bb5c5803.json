  "summary": "On November 15, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament, Inc., a New York limited-liability company managed by brothers Stephen and Richard Troy, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Greenburgh, New York, the Sisters' complaint alleges that the federal law preempts state law claims for contribution and negligence.  The complaint also alleges that, in the event of a state law violation, the defendants would be entitled to compensation for the losses incurred by the victims of the violations.  For example, as alleged in the complaint, if the state law is preempted, then the defendants' claim would be preempted.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On November 16, 2016, the court entered a temporary restraining order against the Defendants, freezing the Defendants' assets, and ordering the Defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the Defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay civil penalties, imposing injunctive relief, and imposing officer-and-director and penny stock bars.  Separately, the Court issued an order temporarily restraining the Defendants from violating the anti-discrimination provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and ordering S&R Development Estates, LLC to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Bort. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency."
