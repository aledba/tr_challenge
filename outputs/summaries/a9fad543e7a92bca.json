  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a separate guardian ad litem (GAL) to represent the interests and best interests of a dependent child.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that J.K.M., a 16 year old girl who had previously been declared dependent but remained in the care of M.other's mother, repeatedly failed to attend medical appointments.  According to the complaint, as a result of this failure to appreciate the seriousness of [Child's] asthma and the impact on her health, the GAL should have appointed a separate attorney to represent her best interests.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, on multiple occasions, Child had been staying with her boyfriend because of a fight she had with [Mother].  The complaint further alleges that Child's health issues and Mother's failures to manage her medical condition necessitated placement.  As a result, Child was hospitalized on more than one occasion and required to be hospitalized on numerous occasions.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Child consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2,500, and a $100,000 civil penalty for a second time.   The final judgment also permanently enjoins Child from future violations of Section 6311 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers and Advocates\") and orders Child to comply with the Commission's requests for a separate GAL to represent Child's best interests in termination proceedings as opposed to dependency proceedings.  Separately, the court granted Child's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Child to return to Mother's home.  On August 24, 2017, the Honorable Deborah M. Bentsen of the Philadelphia Regional Office issued an order appointing a separate Guardian Ad Litem for Child. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by David A. Kasper and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office."
