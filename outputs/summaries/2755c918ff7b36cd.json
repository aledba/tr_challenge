  "summary": "On May 12, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of West Virginia entered a final judgment against Heather Jewell, PA-C, denying her motion for a new trial.  According to the court's order, Jewell and her husband, Dr. Harvey Reisenweber, of Wheeling, W.Va., violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The court also found that, in denying Jewell's motion for new trial, the court improperly allowed her expert, an expert in family practice medicine, to interject into the case that the decedent agreed with her treatment plan.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for West Virginia today announced criminal charges against Jewell.  Separately, the SEC filed an emergency action and obtained a temporary restraining order and an order halting the issuance of the emergency court order.  On May 13, 2016 the court granted the SEC's request for a preliminary injunction and issued an order prohibiting Jewell from making materially false and misleading statements to the jury in connection with her motion to be re-instituted as a defendant in the case.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $10,000.  Additionally, the judge granted the defendants' request for an emergency court injunction and ordered Jewell to provide testimony as to the cause of his death.  A hearing scheduled for May 19, 2016 was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Eastern time.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Christopher T. Nace and Ms. Brown. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Virginia State Attorney General's Office, and the Virginia Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
