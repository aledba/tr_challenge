  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Colorado today entered a final judgment in favor of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDHE) against Scott McLaughlin, a physician licensed to practice medicine in Colorado.  The court found that McLaughlin had a duty to investigate medical marijuana complaints, and that the subpoena served on him violated the agency\u2019s statutory authority to investigate allegations of unprofessional conduct. The court also found that the subpoenas were for a lawfully authorized purpose because the subpoena was based on a referral of a physician to the Board of Medical Examiners.  McLaughlin also alleged that the CDPHE had not directed McLaughlin to respond to the subpoena.  According to the court order, McLaughlin was not required to comply with the subpoena because the Board was acting within the scope of its statutory authority and did not require the subpoena to be issued for a lawful purpose.  In addition, the court found McLaughlin liable for a civil injunctive action for violating the subpoena provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's judgment, the Board consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins McLaughlin from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Denver Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Colorado Office of Inspector General, and the Colorado Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
