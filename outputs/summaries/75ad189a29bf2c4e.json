  "summary": "On July 2, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Southern Furniture Leasing Inc., YRC Worldwide Inc., Roadway Express, Inc. and Yellow Transportation, Inc., for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, Southern and YRC entered into a contract with defendants whereby defendants would reweigh shipments and correct the weight in their billing system to accurately reflect the actual weight of the goods that defendants ship.  The complaint alleges that defendants routinely overcharged their customers, who were unaware of this practice.  For example, according to the complaint, in 2006, defendants instituted a practice whereby it systematically and deliberately eliminated negative reweigheds from registering in its customer billing system.  As a result, defendants overcharged customers, many of whom were unaware that this practice generated over $100 million in revenue.  In addition, the SEC alleges that, as a result of this alleged overcharging, Southern, YRC and Yellow have lost approximately $100,000 since 2005.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Southern has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement of $12 million, prejudgment interest of $2 million, and a civil penalty of $5,000,000.  Southern has also agreed to pay a $20,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson."
