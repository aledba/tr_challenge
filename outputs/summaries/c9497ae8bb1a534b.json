  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas today entered a final judgment against a Texas-based oil and gas company and its former manager in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that Samuel D. Orbison violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Orbison was employed by Ma-Tex Rope Company, Inc. as the manager of its wireline recertification division, and that he solicited and received commissions on two wireline services that were not recertified.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, after Orbison left the company in 2013, he sent dozens of solicitation emails to ma-Tex's customers in an effort to secure two recertifications orders.  As alleged, these emails included \"discounted\" price lists, which were consistent with the price lists Orbison used to solicit his customers.    The complaint further alleges that Orbison failed to disclose that he had received a commission on the two services he performed, which was unrelated to the nature of the alleged misconduct.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and requiring them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $2,321.00 each. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Aug. 24, 2016).  The litigation will be led by David A. McCluskey and Ms. Gibson under the supervision of C.J. Kerstetter. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa."
