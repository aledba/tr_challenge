  "summary": "On July 25, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland entered a final judgment against a former customer service representative for Schwan Food Company who was injured while performing work related activities at his home.  The court found that, contrary to the company's representations to the court, Schwan was not liable for any injury that arose out of or in the course of his employment.  Schwan's complaint, filed in federal district court in Baltimore, Maryland, alleged that, on January 28, 2016, while working as a sales representative at Schwan, Ryan Frederick, injured his right leg while performing a work related activity.  According to the complaint, the injury occurred while performing his work related duties at home and occurred while he was preparing to drop his son off at daycare.  As alleged, the complaint further alleged that Mr. Frederick did not use his home as a work site and instead used his home to conduct his work as a personal errand.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Maryland today announced criminal charges against Frederick, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Frederick consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $10,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 24, 2016).  The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
