  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against two former foster parents who were charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Traverse City, Michigan, alleges that, from at least March 2017 through August 2018, the former foster parent and her adult son, both of whom had been placed in foster care, were falsely told that their parental rights were in the children\u2019s best interests.  According to the complaint, however, as a result of their neglect, they were unable to provide for their children, and the children had been sent to live in a home that was unsuitable for them.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the former parent and adult son had been verbally and physically abused by others, including one who had recently become ill and had been incarcerated.  As a result, the children were often left in the care of their mother or father, who had been previously incarcerated and sentenced to prison.   The complaint further alleges that one of the former parents was verbally abusive to the other, and he had threatened to kick her out of the home if she did not comply with a court order to remove her from the home.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties.  On August 2, 2019, the court granted a temporary restraining order against the defendants and ordered them to return to their respective homes.  A hearing scheduled for September 5, 2019 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Department of Children and Family Services, the State Attorney General's Office, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the FBI Criminal Investigation Division, the Ohio Department of Health and Human Services Criminal Investigations, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Office of Inspector General. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
