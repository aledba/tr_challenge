  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against GeoVera Specialty Insurance Company, Inc., a Florida-based insurance company, for failing to pay for a covered loss that occurred on December 19, 2015.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that, on or about November 21, 2017, GeoVIera filed an affirmative defense against claims that it had failed to fully pay for the 2015 loss.  According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that the company failed to timely raise collateral source evidence at trial, as required by Rule 9(b) of the insurance policy, and failed to do so in its affirmative defense.  As alleged, the company's affirmative defense was based on an estimate prepared by public adjuster Jorge Aucar of Star Public Adjusters Inc., and was untimely because the company never intended to be paid twice.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to the final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their ill-gotten gains.  In addition, the court ordered GeoVI to pay a civil penalty of $129,484.49, a total of $1,845.72, and an officer-and-director bar of $5,077.73, for interior damage incurred as a result of Hurricane Irma.  GeoVI also agreed to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney under Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay an officer and director bar in the form of a \"Concealment or Fraud\" provision of the Insurance Act of 1940.   The court also granted the defendants' motion for leave to amend their affirmative defenses, which are subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Jose Rodriguez and Marcee K. Rodriguez. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Miami Office of Financial Regulation."
