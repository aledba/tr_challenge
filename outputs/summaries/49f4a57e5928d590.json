  "summary": "On June 1, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment in favor of a pension fund's motion to amend its default judgment.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Boston, Massachusetts, alleges that, in March 2016, New England Teamsters and Trucking Industry Pension Fund (\"the Pension Fund\") improperly entered a Rule 59(d) motion for attorneys' fees in violation of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, the pension fund initially opposed the motion, claiming that the Rule 59 motion was entered in error because it failed to include interest, liquidated damages, and attorney fees and costs, as required by Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that the Commission improperly granted the Pension Fund's request for a new period for filing fees.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the Commission's Judgment on Remand (\"Remand\") requires a court to determine whether a motion for attorney's fees is timely and appropriate, and requires the Commission to award additional judgment amounts in the millions of dollars to be paid by the parties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission&rsquo;s Complaint\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0statement\u00c2\u00a0that the Commission had improperly entered Rule 59 in error, it has agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins the Commission from violating Rule 59 and orders it to consider all of the relevant provisions of Rule 59. The Commission has also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $340,977.58, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that will be determined by the court upon motion by the Commission.  On June 2, 2017, the Court granted the Commission a temporary restraining order and ordered a hearing on June 5, 2017.  A hearing for the Commission on June 6, 2017 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2014."
