  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of two felony counts of battery.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, alleges that on July 24, 2011, defendant Daron D. Williams, a resident of Overland Park, Kansas, told a jury that a baseball bat was a deadly weapon and that he had to prove he had used it to commit a felony. Williams also allegedly told the jury that he did not have authority to enter the victim's home because he had \"a deadly weapon.\" The complaint also alleges that Williams failed to tell the jury he had a \"bundle of rights\" that included the right to enter a home without a reasonable basis of proof, and that the jury had to determine whether the defendant had committed a felony or a serious battery. The complaint further alleges that the court improperly instructed the jury on the lesser included offenses of aggravated assault, battery, and criminal trespass. The court found that Williams had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Williams to pay a civil penalty of 142 months' imprisonment. Williams agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000, which he will pay in a civil monetary penalty of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Williams. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kansas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kansas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
