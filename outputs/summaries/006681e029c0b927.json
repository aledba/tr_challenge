  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Canadian convicted child pornography violator who was sentenced to 240 months imprisonment and ordered to pay $58,415 in restitution.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Brandon Leal, a Canadian citizen, traveled from Canada into the United States with electronic devices containing hundreds of images and dozens of videos of child pornography. Some of the images depicted in Leal\u2019s materials were sadistic acts involving children, and others depicted infants or toddlers.  According to the complaint, Leal claimed that he had been sexually abused by an older man who made and circulated \"graphic video recordings of Andy\" in which Andy was \"clearly recognizable.\"  The complaint alleges that Leal had suffered losses of $267,038 in future psychological counseling costs and $1,854,925 in future lost income, totaling $2,121,963 in general losses.  Leal also allegedly sought to recover $33,415 for the forensic psychologist and economist's fees.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and Criminal Justice today announced that it has issued an order suspending Leal from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  On August 15, 2016, the court granted Leal's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to pay a total of $57,415.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the Court granted the government's motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered Leal to comply with the court order, and imposed a $25,000 civil penalty against him.  To learn more about restitution, see Litigation Release No. 572 (2014).  The Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  For example, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
