  "summary": "On May 10, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the United States of America and Luedtke Engineering Company for negligently dredging the Black Rock Channel.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Buffalo, N.Y., on July 27, 2018, the Court found that the United Kingdom-based dredging company and its owner, Rich Marine Sales, Inc. (the \"Corps\"), breached their obligations under the dredging contract by failing to provide proper specifications, planning, scoping, or direction necessary to satisfy its obligations under that contract.  The complaint further alleges that the Corps directed Leudtke to over-dredge the channel and dredge outside of the channel up to the bulkhead.  As alleged in the complaint, however, this was essentially contractual in nature.  In fact, the complaint alleges that, in violation of the contract, the Corps violated its obligation to provide reasonable specifications and planning, and in the alternative, it failed to provide any reasonable basis for the Corps' negligent dredging conduct.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000.   The judgment also orders the defendants to pay civil penalties of $150,000 each. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Buffalo Office of Inspector General, the New York Police Department, the Department of Justice's Criminal Division, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigations Division, as well as the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations' Risk Analysis and Detection Center."
