  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Utah today entered a final judgment against Joseph Michael Simpson, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that, in 1995, Simpson, then a resident of Florida, engaged in a long-running sexual relationship with a woman he met through his work as an airport shuttle driver.  According to the complaint, while Simpson was incarcerated in the Wasatch County Jail, he engaged in the practice of patronizing sex workers while living in Utah and may have had sex with one of the victims.  As alleged, the complaint alleges that Simpson told the woman that he had recently relocated from out of state and was a sex worker, and that he used the company shuttle to pick up those workers.   The complaint further alleges that the woman had recently moved to Utah and was living in the country when she was murdered.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Simpson.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Simpson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Additionally, the court ordered Simpson to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and ordered him to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Salt Lake Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. \u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Office of the Attorney General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Utah State Corporation Commission, the Uinta County Sheriff's Office, the FBI, and Utah Attorney General's Office in this matter."
