  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on February 5, 2016, entered a final judgment against defendants Allstate Insurance Company and Farmers Group LLC/North American Compass Insurance Services, Inc. (Allstate) in a class action action brought by property inspectors alleging that their employer misclassified them as independent contractors.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, defendants raised the issue of whether or not they were entitled to class certification based on the number of inspections performed by inspectors for Allstate, Farmers, and Allstate.  The complaint alleges that defendants failed to disclose that they performed inspections for all three insurance companies, and failed to adequately account for the wide range of work-practice variations among inspectors.  In addition, the complaint alleges defendants' trial plan failed to account for common issues, such as how many inspections inspectors performed, how many meals or rest breaks inspectors took, and how many hours inspectors spent on minimum wage and rest breaks.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and other relief.  Additionally, defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit, without admitting to the existence of any such security deposit.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David J. Brinker, Yvonne Beckner, Terry Quimby, and April J. Jackson of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the California Office of Inspector General in this matter."
