  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered default judgment against Iran for its material support for the torture and hostage-taking of three U.K. citizens in Iraq.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Waiel El-Maadawy, Amr Mohamed, and Russell Frost were kidnapped and held for a month by the militant group Saraya al-Salam. According to the complaint, the three men were held in cells so small that they could not stand up or lie down. The complaint alleges that the three were tortured and held in the cells for more than a week, and that they were threatened with execution if they did not comply with the court's orders. The SEC alleges that, in addition to being held in captivity, the men were also held in \"broader context\" of Iran's conduct, including the release of hostages in Iraq under the direction of Muqtada al-Sadr and the IRGC or Quds Force. The court also found that the kidnapping was a \"pre-eminent role in the creation of\" the JCPOA. The Court's order granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the three victims' injuries.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of International Affairs today announced that it has issued an order suspending the suspension of the suspension pending final approval by the court of the emergency relief ordered by the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle East.  On May 24, 2019, the court entered default against Iran on all three of its alleged violations of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) and ordered it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Iran has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins it from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to conduct a conduct-based investigation that will be conducted by the Office of Inspector General of the United Kingdom, the Department of Justice, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).  The court's order also provides for the appointment of a Special Judge to determine the amount of monetary penalties to be imposed upon each of the defendants.  For further information, see Litigation Release Order No. 17-cv-01-2019.   The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy encourages investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a business."
