  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arizona today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was convicted of manslaughter for his role in a 2015 triple homicide.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Phoenix, Arizona, alleges that, on June 12, 2016, defendant M.R. brought his son to the apartment complex where he and his step-daughter, Autumn, had a son together.  According to the complaint, the defendant told the son that he was going to use deadly force in defense of premises under the federal securities laws, and that he feared for his life when he attempted to take his son out of the apartment.  Instead, the complaint alleges, defendant allegedly held the baby in his arms and shoulders and asked the son to leave the apartment so he could \"protect\" the baby.  In a parallel action, the Arizona Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed criminal charges against M. R. Rushing, who was charged with the same conduct.  Rushing has agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The SEC also agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Arizona Court of Appeals entered a judgment ordering a temporary restraining order, ordering a preliminary injunction, and ordering a conduct-based injunction against further violations of Section 13 of the Exchange Act. The court granted the SEC\u2019s request for an emergency asset freeze and ordered a hearing on May 24, 2019.  A hearing on June 26, 2019 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern. The hearing will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-419(C)(2). The SEC encourages the public to check the backgrounds of people who commit a crime by using the search tool on the SEC.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and whether they have any background in law enforcement."
