  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Jehovah's Witness organization for failing to produce documents related to child sexual abuse.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, on January 2, 2013, Judge Vincent D. Lozano issued a temporary restraining order and ordered Watchtower to produce materials related to the alleged abuse of children by a member of another Jehovah's Witnesses congregation.  The complaint alleges that the court found that Watchtower violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that it violated the pre-judgment provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Watchtower agreed to the court's order and agreed to pay $37,799.21 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of the alleged damages.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against Watchtower.  On March 27, 2014, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction and entered a default judgment against the defendants, ordering them to comply with the court order and ordering the destruction of documents requested by the complaint.  At a hearing on April 4, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the U.N. Division of Justice issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the court as part of a litigated proceeding.  As part of the settlement, the defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and to pay a civil monetary penalty of $38,799, which is equal to their disgorgment and prejudgment interests, and to be subject to court approval of the settlements.  After the hearing, the judge granted the request for a temporary injunction and ordered the destruction and destruction of the documents requested, and the defendants to return to their respective homes to complete their duties as a court-appointed receiver of the children's books and records.  A hearing scheduled for June 27, 2019, was not conducted as scheduled for that date.  Last week, the SEC issued a subpoena for documents relating to alleged child molestation by another member of the same congregation, who was also charged by the court with violating the anti-fraud provisions.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Los Angeles Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson."
