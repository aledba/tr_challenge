  "summary": "On October 4, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against Freedom Medical Inc., a Pennsylvania-based medical equipment sales company, and three individuals for misappropriating its trade secrets.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, Freedom Medical, a medical equipment company, was in the business of renting and selling medical equipment to hospitals, nursing homes and other healthcare providers.  The complaint alleges that Freedom Medical's sales representatives shared confidential information with Med One sales representatives, including pricing information, business plans and customer lists.  As alleged in the complaint, the confidential information was shared with the sales representatives so that Med One's sales teams could quickly and easily determine whether to price the equipment at a competitive price.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Liberty Medical consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Freedom Medical from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Freedom Medical to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Liberty Medical and three individual defendants for their roles in the alleged misappropriation.  On October 5, 2017, the Court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered Freedom Medical and the individual defendants to comply with the court's order.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John G. Bryant and Eric Wenzel of the Philadelphia Regional Office and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. Bryant, Ms. Werner, and Mr. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Philadelphia Office of Financial Regulation, and the Pennsylvania Office of Insurance Regulation."
