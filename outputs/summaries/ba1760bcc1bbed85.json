  "summary": "On July 24, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a temporary restraining order against Adelfio Garcia, a special education teacher with the Chicago Public Schools, from violating the attorney-client privilege. According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, Mr. Garcia provided a declaration for a deposition in which he claimed that Mr. Soria told him to use an unsatisfactory rating to get rid of teachers he didn't like and that that was the way it was done at CPS. The complaint alleges that, according to the complaint, Garcia replied to the deposition by saying that he understood that making a false statement under oath constituted perjury and that he would need legal representation.  The complaint further alleges that the Declaration was not filed until 11 days later, and that, in the wake of the deposition, Garcia changed his story on the 24th.  As alleged, however, the Defendants' counsel never called the court to respond to their requests for a hearing.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Garcia. The SEC also announced civil injunctions against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and an officer-and-director bar against Garcia from appearing before the court as a witness.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On July 26, the court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered a hearing on July 27, 2018 to determine whether to proceed with the litigation. The hearing was scheduled for 11:30 a.m. EST on July 25, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 539, 542 (7th Cir. 1999).  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert about potential conflicts of interest arising from litigation arising from this matter.
