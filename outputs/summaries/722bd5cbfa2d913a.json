  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Humberto Trujillo, a former manager of an Ashley Furniture Home Store in Chicago, for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, from June 2007 through March 2016, a Wisconsin company owned and operated by Rockledge Furniture LLC failed to file a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that the company was not named as a party in its charge, and that the complaint was filed in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that Trujilla failed to adequately exhaust his administrative remedies because he did not name his employer, and because the company never contacted anyone at that address or phone number.  In a parallel action, on May 13, 2016, the United States District Court in the District of Columbia entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the company from violating the anti-discrimination provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. The court also granted the company's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits it from issuing or selling any security or other security-related documents, and ordered the company to provide a copy of the complaint to the court. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (July 2017).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the Department of Justice today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action against the company that filed the complaint with the SEC.   The complaint charges Rockledge with violations of the Administrative Procedure Act of 1940, Sections 10(e) and 13(b)(5) and 14(a)(2) and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Rockledge has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations"
