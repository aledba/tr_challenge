  "summary": "The Kansas Department of Revenue today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting an administrative suspension of a person's driver's license.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Kansas, alleges that, on February 6, 2017, a Merriam Police Department officer unlawfully stopped Nathan A. Jarvis, a Kansas resident, for driving under the influence of alcohol. The complaint alleges that the officer had reasonable suspicion to stop Jarvis after he saw him weaving in and out of lanes without signaling and crossing the center line of the road. According to the complaint, as a result of the officer's actions, Jarvis was suspended from driving and his driving privileges were temporarily suspended. The SEC alleges that Hirsch failed to comply with the court's order, and the officer was subsequently ordered to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  In a parallel action, the Kansas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against the officer.  On February 9, 2018, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the officer to submit to a breath test. The court also issued an order suspending Jarvis from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, and sale of any automobile, including one that was registered with the Kansas Secretary of State's Office.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Hirsch consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay civil penalties of $150,000 and $100,000, respectively. The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about the Administrative Suspension of a Driver's License case, see the Kansas Driver's Licensing and Licensing Commission's website."
