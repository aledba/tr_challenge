  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Maryland today announced criminal charges against a Maryland attorney for failing to timely file income tax returns and pay taxes.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Charles Darrow Yates violated Rule 8.4(b) and (c) of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore on January 16, 2019, Mr. Yates was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of The Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 17(b)(5) thereunder, and that he violated Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the attorney consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, imposes a 30-day suspension from the practice of law, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $7,500.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Department of Justice today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action against Yates, charging him with violations of Rule 13a-14, and ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $8,500, $1,000, and $2,500 in disgorgement.   The complaint also alleges that, during his third decade as a member of the bar, he failed to file required tax returns for tax years 2011 through 2017 inclusive.  As a result of his misconduct, he has not been charged with a crime of moral turpitude, and the SEC has not charged him with a criminal violation of Rule 12b-20.  Instead, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the proposed order.  On January 19, 2020, the Honorable Judge Thomas F. Stansfield of the Maryland Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order and issued an order suspending Yates from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney.  To learn more about attorney misconduct, see Attorney Grievance Comm'n v. Giannetti, 350 Md. 446, 451, 644 A.2d 43 (1994).  The Court's order also requires that the attorney provide a copy of the IRS' Form 10-Q, which is required by the federal law to file tax returns.
