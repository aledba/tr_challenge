  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a former romantic partner who allegedly committed two separate acts of domestic violence.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in New York, on August 5, 2015, defendant, who was deployed to Guantanamo Bay with the Coast Guard, engaged in an aggressive and aggressive conduct toward his ex-girlfriend, A. The complaint alleges that defendant repeatedly kicked her out of the apartment, kicked a $1,000 television that belonged to A, and damaged a window in the apartment.  The complaint further alleges that A confronted defendant about the conduct on August 6 and confronted him about it the next morning.  As alleged in the complaint, defendant responded that he did not want to have sex with A and that he had slapped her on the back and kicked her in the face.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney\u2019s Office for New York filed criminal charges in August 2015 against defendant for the same conduct.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, A consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On August 6, A pleaded guilty to one count of criminal mischief and was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and ordered to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  A jury deliberated for two days before finding her guilty on August 7.  After deliberating for a few hours, the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order and ordered A to return to her apartment, where she spent the night.   The SEC complaint charges defendant with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule\u00c2\u00a0206(4)-8 thereunder and seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and a penalty equal to the amount of money that A has already paid in restitution to the victims of the two alleged acts.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 206 (2) of 2018."
