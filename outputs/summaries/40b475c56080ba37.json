  "summary": "On February 2, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Possible Productions Inc. (Possible), Showtime Pictures Development Company (Showtime), and Travis Rehwaldt, asserting claims for sex discrimination under the New York City Human Rights Law (NYCHRL) (Count 3) and for retaliation under Title VII (Count 4) of the federal antidiscrimination laws (NYSHRL).  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, from October 2013 to September 2015 as a body double for the character of Alison on the television show The Affair, Plaintiff received a call sheet describing her role as, \"Alison Sexytime Double.\"  The complaint alleges that she was told that she did not have a good hair match with the actress playing Ashley and that the show was looking for someone else to fill her role.  As alleged in the complaint, the call sheet also described Plaintiff as having a \"flimsy explanation for why she was no longer needed\" on the duration of her role, despite the fact that her replacement also wore a wig.  The SEC alleges that the complaint further alleges that, on September 24, 2015, the day after she received the Call Sheet, she was dismissed from her position as an assistant director on the show.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On February 3, 2020, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the Defendants, charging them with violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Exchange Act Rule 12(b)(6) thereunder, and with aiding and abetting Defendants' violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) and of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.  Additionally, Defendants agreed to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of their disgorge and prejudgment interests, and to pay civil penalties of $5,000 and $1,500, respectively.  Defendants also agreed to be barred from serving as officers or directors of any public company or from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply as an officer or director of a public company.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No."
