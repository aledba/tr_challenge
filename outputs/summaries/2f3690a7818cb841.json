  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia today entered a final judgment in favor of a district court ordering the disclosure of grand jury records related to the Moore\u2019s Ford lynching.  The court entered the final judgment against Anthony S. Pitch, a historian who authored several books about the subject of the lynching, agreeing that the court should exercise its inherent, supervisory power over the grand jury to authorize disclosure of the records.  In its judgment, the court found that, as a matter of principle, a court should have the right to determine whether a grand jury member should be required to disclose the records of a criminal case.  According to the court's order, however, the order did not apply to all grand jury proceedings.  For example, in one case, a federal district court issued an order requiring the release of documents in violation of Rule 6(e).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Pitch, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Pitch consented to the entry of a final judgement that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to comply with the court order.  On May 24, 2019, the Honorable Paul G. Sansone of the U. S. District Judge's Office in Atlanta issued a temporary restraining order against Pitch and ordered him to surrender his passport and other documents.  As part of the settlement, Sansone agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of the charged sections of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.  Sansone also agreed to be enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with a federal criminal proceeding, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  To learn more about grand jury secrecy, see Litigation Release Release Release Order No. 17-cv-17 (2014).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Georgia Office of Inspector General, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
