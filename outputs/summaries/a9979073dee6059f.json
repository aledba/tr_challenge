  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Commissioner of Social Security for denying a claimant's application for disability insurance benefits.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Buffalo, N.Y., alleges that, from at least November 2015 through March 2016, Michelene Insalaco, a resident of Buffalo, New York, was unable to perform any past relevant work due to stage III breast cancer, depression, anxiety, and Wolf Parkinson White syndrome. The complaint further alleges that Dr. Bauer completed a functional assessment on September 30, 2015, during which he found that Plaintiff was \"very limited\" in several areas of functioning, including lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, and in doing stairs or other climbing.  According to the complaint, this finding conflicts with the recommendations of two other physicians, Ronald J. Bauer, M.D. and Jennifer Hydeman, Ph.D., who agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Insalac.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the SEC has issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent examination of all claims, including that of the individual who filed the complaint. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against the defendants.  On March 7, 2017, the U. S. District Judge in Buffalo granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order and ordered an accounting of the defendants' alleged violations of Section 5 of the federal securities laws.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Halloran and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Insalaca. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
