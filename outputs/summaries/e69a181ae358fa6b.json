  "summary": "On June 27, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia entered a final judgment against Tara Retail Group, LLC (\"Tara Retail\"), a West Virginia-based company that owns and operates Elkview Crossings Shopping Mall in Elkview, West Virginia.  According to the court's order, on May 22, 2017, Tara Retail and its principal secured creditor, Dollar Tree Stores, filed a proof of claim for $276,969.28, which consisted of overpaid rent from June 2016 through November 2016; $150,000 in lost profits; and $95,000 to reopen for business.  The court also ruled that the amount of the claim should not be determined by the parties until the parties agreed to a plan of reorganization.  In a parallel action, on March 9, 2018 (D.T. No. 13), the U-S. Bankruptcy Commission filed an emergency action and obtained an emergency court order to expedite the filing of the emergency action.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in West Virginia, charges Tara Retail with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the CFTC have agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of final judgments, orders, and orders of the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Robert J. Keach and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry and Ms. Burt of the Commission's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, and the case will be supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay."
