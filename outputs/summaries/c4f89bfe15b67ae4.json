  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida yesterday entered a final judgment against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and its mortgage servicer, HSBC Bank USA, NA., in a related action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that Wells Fargo violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Wells Fargo failed to adequately respond to the allegations in the 2014 QWR and the 2015 QWR, and instead delayed sending the QWR to the servicer until after Wells Fargo had failed to respond to their complaint.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in a parallel action, the district court dismissed Wells Fargo\u2019s earlier action in state court on the basis of insufficient evidence.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $104,997.39 plus interest and penalties equal to the amount of money Wells Fargo paid to them in the prior foreclosure action. The judgment also orders Wells Fargo to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is twice as much as the amount Wells Fargo has already paid to settle the foreclosure action in the state court.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted in the Miami Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by John Rymas. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Miami Office of Inspector General, the Florida Department of Banking, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Florida Secretary of State's Office.
