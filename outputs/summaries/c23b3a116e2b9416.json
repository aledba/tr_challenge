  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Texas resident Ricky Grubbs in a civil injunctive action brought by the Campbell Children.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on March 9, 2015, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, the court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that, in violation of Section 16.069 of the Exchange Act, the defendants failed to adequately represent to the court that they owned all of the disputed minerals and royalty interests in the property.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  Additionally, the Court granted the Defendants' motion for summary judgment in the case, which was subject to court approval, to hold a hearing on the merits of the case and to order the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which would be offset by the defendants' attorney's fees.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Fort Worth Regional Office, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of overcharging investors in oil-and-gas development projects.
