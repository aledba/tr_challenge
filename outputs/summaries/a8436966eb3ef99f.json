  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma today entered a final judgment against Oklahoma Roofing & Sheet Metal, Inc., a company owned and operated by Crystal Wells, a former administrator of the Estate of Robert Young, Deceased.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Oklahoma City, alleges that Oklahoma's workers' compensation law is inconsistent with that of the federal government.  According to the complaint, Oklahoma's law requires an employer to have a sufficient fall protection system in place to prevent an employee's injury from occurring.  For example, Oklahoma requires that an employee unhook his single line lanyard when he is required to do so by an employer even though the employee knew that the safety anchor was inoperable.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Oklahoma and Wells consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Crystal Wells for her role in the alleged scheme.  As set forth in the order, Crystal Wells is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  On May 2, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Washington entered a temporary restraining order and ordered Crystal Wells to comply with the court's order.  She has not yet complied with the order and has not agreed to a hearing or to a judgment ordering her to consent to the imposition of a civil injunctive action.  To learn more about intentional tort liability, see Litigation Release No. 1057, 1066-67, April 5, 2018. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations has also issued an Investor Alert about potential violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Oklahoma Attorney General's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
