  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in a civil injunctive action brought by the National Organization of Veterans' Advocates, Inc. (NOVA).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the VA violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 17(b)(5) and Rules 17b-5 thereunder.  The complaint further alleges that, contrary to the VA\u2019s longstanding interpretation of the federal rule, the VA failed to consider the synergistic effect of multiple disabilities when evaluating extra-schedular ratings for veterans.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Department has agreed to the entry of a final rule that permanently enjoins the VA from violating the federal securities laws, requires the VA to evaluate multiple disabilities in isolation, and requires the determination by the Director of Compensation and Pension Service of whether a particular disability is appropriate for that specific disability.  In addition, the proposed rule requires the agency to determine whether a veteran qualifies for an extra-chedular rating based on the number of service-connected disabilities that result in a total disability, and that the agency must determine whether to use the extra-capricious rating as a basis for evaluating the effectiveness of the other disabilities.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1365-66, July 17, 2018.   The Commission's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Personnel Management in this matter."
