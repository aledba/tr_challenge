  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, in violation of Section 706(1), the defendants failed to identify any reviewable \"agency action\" over which the court could exercise jurisdiction.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants misrepresented that the 2020 Census would produce an even greater differential undercount of the communities represented by the plaintiffs.  According to the complaint, the defendants' claims were based on \"discrete\" and \"simply the result of a choice of methodology\" that the Census Bureau had made.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the federal securities laws, ordering the defendants to disgorge their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and ordering the plaintiffs to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.   The settlements are subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2019, the U.N. Office of Inspector General issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Philadelphia Regional Office by Robert E. Ross, Kelly L. Gibson, and Patrick J. McCluskey of the Market Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson under the supervision of C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency."
