  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Iowa today announced criminal charges against a Mason City, Iowa man accused of stealing a riding lawn mower.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Des Moines, alleges that Charles Ross and his codefendant, Calvin Lacey, arrived at a Mills Fleet Farm in a rental truck on September 24, 2018, in possession of bolt cutters and a tool with the intent to use it in the unlawful removal of a theft detection device under section 714.7B(3) of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, Ross then helped Lacey load the lawnmower onto the rental truck without permission or consent from the store employee.  Ross and Lacey allegedly used the tool to remove the padlock-steel cable combination, which was attached to the riding lawn lawnower, without Ross's knowledge or consent.  In a parallel action, the Iowa Attorney General's Office today announced that Ross has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a penalty of seven years and a $200,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Ross has consented to a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  On May 31, 2019, Ross pleaded guilty to one count of theft in the second degree, a class \u201cD\u201d felony, and was sentenced to three consecutive sentences totaling seven years.  He also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any electronic or other device that does not serve any clear theft detection function, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of five years and five months.  As part of the settlement, Ross agreed to a seven-year prison term and to a five-year officer and director bar, and agreed to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,965, which will be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see the SEC complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on May 15, 1931. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Iowa Department of Commerce in this matter."
