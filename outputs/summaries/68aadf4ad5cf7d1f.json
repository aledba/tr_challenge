  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against a Pennsylvania man for two separate drug-related convictions.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that Edward Glenn Appellant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he violated the double jeopardy provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, the defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions of Sections 303.6 and 303.5 of the Exchange Act, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of a controlled substance, or any other conduct that constitutes a prior criminal conviction. The court also agreed to a four-part test to determine whether a defendant is entitled to a five-year sentence for a prior felony conviction and a six-year probation for a delivery conviction. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, and bars him from serving any prison term beyond five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Department of Justice today announced that it has instituted a parallel criminal investigation. The investigation was conducted by Michael J. Farrow and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
