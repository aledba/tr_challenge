  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case.  According to the court's order, filed on February 10, 2017, the defendants failed to disclose the value of Ms. Clark's shares when they filed a complaint in state court against the bankruptcy court for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that the defendants did not violate the fiduciary duties of a bankruptcy court by failing to disclose material facts about the bankruptcy proceedings.  In addition, the court found that Appellants' failure to comply with the defendants' requests for an asset freeze and to pay a ten percent dividend constituted a material default of the creditors' claims.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of $42,250, prejudgment interest of $1,200, and a civil penalty of $250,000.  On March 10, 2015, after the filing of the bankruptcy petition, Appellant filed a second amended complaint, this time against the valuation of her company's shares.  As alleged in the complaint, that same day, Appelants filed a third amended complaint against the defendants, this one against a trustee who did not meet the valuation requirements of the final judgment.  Appelleants' amended complaint charges the defendants with violating Section 10b of the Exchange Act and Rule 12b-20 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, an officer-and-director bar, a penny stock bar, and an officer and director bar.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry in the San Francisco Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
