  "summary": "On February 20, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment against Uber Technologies, Inc. (\"Uber\"), a Massachusetts-based ride-hailing company, for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston on February 21, 2016, Uber and its co-founders, Jacqueline N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Elizabeth Schaul, and Ross McDonagh, raised the issue of whether or not to compel arbitration in an online contract.  The complaint alleges that, in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, that Uber violated a provision of the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\") that requires third parties to pay certain fictitious or inflated fees.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Uber has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $8.75 per trip, $5.25 for the East Boston toll, and $8,75 for a Massport Surcharge & Toll.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against Uber.  On February 24, 2017, the District Court entered a temporary restraining order against Uber from further violations of the securities laws, ordering the company to disgorge its allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties of $10,000 and $20,000, respectively.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Boston Regional Office and the case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
