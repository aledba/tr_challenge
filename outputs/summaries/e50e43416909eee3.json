  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Florida-based tax preparer Jason Stinson, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of $949,952.47.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that Stinson defrauded hundreds of low-income customers by preparing and filing tax returns that falsely claimed the maximum earned income tax credit (EITC) for customers, falsely claiming fictitious dependents, fabricating unreimbursed employee business expenses, and charging customers excessively high fees.  According to the complaint, many of Stinson's customers have been audited by the IRS and, consequently, owe money on their modest incomes as a result of their tax returns.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Stinson consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal tax laws, and orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against Stinson.  To settle the charges, the court agreed to a permanent injunction, which requires the SEC to provide a full accounting of the amount of any disgorged or unearned profits and losses, and requires the company to pay a civil penalty of $1,584,481.79.  Stinson has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any tax return, whether by law or by association with any person or entity other than himself.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (Dec. 31, 2014).  In its order, the SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Florida Office of Financial Regulation in this matter."
