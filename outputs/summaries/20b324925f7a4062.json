  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania yesterday entered final judgments in favor of Joseph G. McDonald and LTC Associates, LLC (LTC Associates) in connection with a July 2008 motor vehicle accident.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on July 1, 2008, at approximately 5:30 p.m., Appellant parked her Chevrolet Equinox alongside the northbound lane of Hudson Street in Forest City, Pennsylvania.  The complaint alleges that, after she exited the vehicle, Mr. McDonald entered the southbound lane and drove to the nursing home.  As alleged in the complaint, after he entered the car, he drove to his sister-in-law's house to repair her porch and hit her as she was standing by her vehicle.  In a parallel action, on August 12, 2010, a federal district court in Philadelphia entered a final judgment against McDonald, finding that, at the time of the accident, McDonald was negligent in not acting within the scope of his employment and with the consent of the co-defendant.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, McDonald consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $350,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court at a later date.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Spitsin and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Pennsylvania Department of Insurance, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
