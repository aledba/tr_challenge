  "summary": "On September 30, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Theriot, finding that she violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering Theriot to submit a second amended complaint to the court.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Orleans, alleges that Theriot failed to disclose that the Fund's March 2, 2018 benefit denial letter was untimely and did not substantially comply with ERISA.  According to the complaint, Theriot's amended complaint alleges that, in reality, the Fund failed to respond to her request for a full and fair review of her claim for benefits.  Theriot also alleges that the fund failed to inform her that the April 18, 2017 letter was non-compliant with the Exchange Act and that it failed to provide her with a reasonable opportunity to file a timely appeal of her denial.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced that it filed criminal charges and obtained a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of Theriot and prohibiting her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with her claims.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the court has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Theriot from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and requires her to comply with a court order requiring her to show cause and consent to entry of an order imposing a preliminary injunction.  Additionally, the Court has issued an order appointing a receiver for Theriot in a case where the receiver has a right to reapply after 90 days of receiving a response from the receiver, ordering her to respond within sixty days of receipt of the receiver's response, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the New York Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
