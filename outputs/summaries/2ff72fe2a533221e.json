  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 452.375 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that A.E.R. (\u201cFather\u201d) was liable for failing to comply with the court\u2019s orders in granting him sole legal and physical custody of a minor child.  According to the complaint, the court found that the defendant failed to consider the needs of the child and failed to determine whether the child was capable of working and earning when, in fact, Mother was receiving disability benefits.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the trial court improperly appointed a second defendant to determine the appropriate amount of custody for the child based on his repeated violations of the court orders.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, Father failed to show sufficient evidence to support the decision and was ordered to pay $115 per month in child support, $3,500 of attorney's fees and $2,450 in court costs.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling investments by using the investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Father on June 5, 2014, charging him with violating Section 17(a) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 17(b) thereunder, and with aiding and abetting Mother's violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 5b2-1.  On June 13, 2019, the Court issued an Order suspending Father from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer and sale of any securities, including securities in the securities of publicly-traded companies, and issuing an order appointing a receiver to oversee the sale and issuance of any security or other security that may be required of a receiver.
