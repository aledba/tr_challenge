  "summary": "On August 15, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia entered a final judgment in favor of the United States in a civil action brought by Frances Smith, the ex-wife of a Georgia lawyer who was convicted of mail fraud and aggravated identity theft.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia on October 22, 2015, Frances Smith learned in January 2018 that her ex-husband had borrowed half a million dollars on their marital home and other real property and lost it by investing in BlinkMind, Inc.  The complaint alleges that, unbeknownst to her, her husband had borrowed a total of $1.285 million from her, deposited forged settlement checks into his firm's trust account, and filed for divorce 30 days afterward.  As alleged in the complaint, the government's restitution lien was attached to all of defendant Smith\u2019s property and rights to property, including his contingent interest in the lawsuit settlement.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Smith consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay $1,285,000 in restitution to the victims of his fraud while he was a lawyer.  In addition, the court granted the government a temporary restraining order and ordered the payment of a civil penalty in the amount of $'433,039.36, which is equal to the amount that Frances Smith has already paid in restitution in the civil case.  On August 16, 2018 the court entered a judgment ordering the government to pay restitution in accordance with the practices and procedures in the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act (FDCPA).  The court also issued an order appointing a receiver to record and record any judgments that may be entered against her in the future without her knowledge or consent.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2019.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Frances Smith on August 17, 2018 against her for violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (3) of Georgia law and for failing to comply with the reporting requirements of Sections 13(a)(1) and 13(b)(2)(A) of federal law and with respect to the registration provision of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of state law.  This action is subject to court approval.   The SEC"
