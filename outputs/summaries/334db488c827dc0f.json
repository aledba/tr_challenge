  "summary": "On June 12, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a Westwego, Illinois man who was convicted of arson with intent to defraud.  The court found that defendant David Costanza, who was employed as the Director of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office's Crime Lab, committed arson in 2014.  According to the court's order, Costanza was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Costanza pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to one year of hard labor to be served in home incarceration with \"ATI.\"  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Orleans, charges Costanza with violating Section 15(b)(2)(A) and Rule 15b2-3 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action against Costanza and his wife, the court also ordered Costanza to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and ordered him to pay $1,500 in disgorgment and prejudgment interests.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC charged a private fire investigator with aiding and abetting Costanza's violations of Section 14(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Section 10-b2(b).  The investigation was conducted by Robert Schaal and supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the New Orleans Regional Office.
