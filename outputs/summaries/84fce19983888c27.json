  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin today entered a final judgment against Greenwich Insurance Company and Steadfast Insurance Company in a multi-pronged action brought by MMSD and its insurance companies in the rain event lawsuits.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Madison, Wis., on June 6, 2008, the court found that Greenwich breached its duty to defend MMSDs in the pre-storm event lawsuits by failing to adequately cover the costs of defending MMSd.  The court also found that, in addition to failing to defend the MMSDS, Greenwich violated the duty to protect and indemnify its insured.  In its judgment, the Court held that, under the doctrine of equitable subrogation, an insurer is entitled to recover from a breach of duty to defense, including, without limitation, the right of the insured to recover the amount of the damages that it has paid to the insured under the policy.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Greenwich agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the obligations of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay $594,302.23 in attorney fees and $325,500 in prejudgment interest.

In addition, the order bars Steadfast's ability to participate in any pre-judgment proceeding in the event of a default judgment in the same case.  Finally, it prohibits the sale or issuance of any other insurance policy without prior approval from the court.  On June 17, 2009, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Greenwich, requiring it to show cause and effect in its complaint that it had breached its obligation to defend, and to pay, the amount and scope of its obligations to defend. In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Greenwich arising from the same conduct alleged in the Rain Event lawsuits. Greenwich has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the"
