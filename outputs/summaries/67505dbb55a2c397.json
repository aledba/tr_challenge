  "summary": "On August 22, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California entered a final judgment in favor of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) against five former correctional officers who were interviewed by the agency in connection with its September 2015 review of High Desert State Prison.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, the former officers, Bryan Blue, Jason Hastey, Steven Oschner, Arthur Tovar, and James McCloughan, refused to participate in the interviews.  The complaint alleges that the officers violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 5b-5 thereunder, and that they violated Section 425 of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating Section 425, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against the officers.  On August 24, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendants, charging them with violating Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Scott Frost and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Frost and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Secretary of State's Office, and the California Attorney General's Office in this matter."
