  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska yesterday entered a final judgment against Western Hay Services, Inc., a Nebraska-based trucking company, and its owner, Johnny Hill, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Scotts Bluff County, Nebraska, alleges that, from September 2008 through September 2009, Great West Casualty Company (Great West) issued Western Hay a commercial lines insurance policy that provided insurance coverage for workers' compensation insurance. The policy included a workers\u2019 compensation exclusion and an employer\u2019s liability exclusion. The complaint further alleges that Great West failed to provide timely and accurate information about the claims in the insurance policy and failed to timely provide payroll information to the insurance broker.  According to the complaint, when a truckload of workers was injured in a truck accident, the truckload was not covered by the insurance company.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court in the Southern District of New York today entered a judgment in favor of Great West, finding that it had no duty to defend Western Hay and that it was liable for liability under the Nebraska Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, Western Hay consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement of $309,154.10 in medical expenses as a result of the alleged negligence. The court also ordered Great West to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $800,000.  Merrick also agreed to be enjoined from associating with any broker or insurance agent that does not have a duty to protect an injured employee from potential liability for failing to provide workers compensation insurance, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 2, 2017, the U. S. District Judge for the Southern Division of New Jersey entered a preliminary injunction against Great West and ordered it to comply with the court order.  This order, which was entered by the court on June 5, 2018, orders Great West not to violate the federal securities laws, imposes a $1.5 million civil penalty, and requires it to provide an accounting of the losses incurred by the injured employee in the course and scope of his or her employment.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC also ordered the broker and insurance agent to jointly and severally disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and impose civil penalties against each of them."
