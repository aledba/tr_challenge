  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a California-based health care company and its retained expert in an emergency management case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, on May 2, 2017, the California Department of Health Services (CDHS) and Blue Cross Medi-Cal managed care organization (MDCS) agreed to settle a civil injunctive action brought by the District Attorney's Office against Blue Cross and MDCS alleging that they violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1300.71(a)(3)(B) of the California Code of Regulations.  The complaint alleges that, in determining the reasonable value of poststabilization services provided to MDCS beneficiaries, the court improperly limited the amount of the full billed charges that Blue Cross paid to the MDCS.  In a parallel action, on June 1, 2018, the U. S. District Attorney for the Southern District of New York unsealed criminal charges against the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of $6,615,502 plus prejudgment interest of $4,138,815, and a civil monetary penalty of $1,000,000.  On June 5, 2018 the Honorable Judge Robert A. Currid of the United States District Court in San Francisco issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering the destruction of any evidence that may be relevant to the determination of reasonable and customary value of the services rendered.  Under the proposed settlement, which is subject to court approval, the parties will be required to show cause and effect why they have agreed to the settlement.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael G. Sansone and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Los Angeles Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Mr. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
