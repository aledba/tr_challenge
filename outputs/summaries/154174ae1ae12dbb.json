  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho today entered a final judgment against defendant Abdon Andre Saenz, Jr., finding him guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boise, Idaho, Saenz was charged with aggravated battery for his role in a September 2013 attempted robbery.  The SEC alleges that Saenz consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Saenz also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged misconduct.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant agreed to a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Saenz.  On May 24, 2019, the U. S. District Judge in Boise issued a temporary restraining order, ordering Saenz to surrender his passport, and ordering him to return to his home state of Idaho, where he will reside for the rest of his life, barring him from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney.   The court also issued a preliminary injunction, ordering the issuance of an order suspending Saenz from appearing, practicing, or appearing in public before the SEC as a defendant. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or individuals selling investments in real estate.  For example, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
