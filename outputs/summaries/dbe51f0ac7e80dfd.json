  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a California-based medical device company and its founder, who was found liable for a $5.1 million civil injunctive penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that, in 2003, Whitney Engler, then a junior college student at the time of her knee surgery, was falsely told that the Polar Care 500 device could reduce her risk of severe knee injuries. Instead, according to the complaint, Engler allegedly used the device to treat a nonfreezing cold injury on her knee, which caused her to experience severe pain and suffering. The complaint further alleges that Engler's counsel, Virginia Bigler-Engler, repeatedly misrepresented to the jury that the device was safe and effective, that she had successfully treated hundreds of clients with the device, and that she did not have any evidence of any serious injuries. In addition, the complaint alleges that Breg, Oasis, and Chao violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Breg and Oasis.  According to the SEC's order, the jury found Engler liable for $5,127,950 in noneconomic damages and ordered her to pay $7 million in civil penalties and a $100,000 civil penalty. The court also issued an order suspending Breg from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $500,000. In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC instituted a parallel criminal investigation. The case was supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Breg. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Insurance, and the California Office of Financial Regulation."
