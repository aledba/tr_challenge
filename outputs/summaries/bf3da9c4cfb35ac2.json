  "summary": "On April 26, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment against Theodore Frank in a class action action brought by a putative class of consumers who purchased glucosamine, a dietary supplement advertised for its benefits to joint health. The court found that Frank violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Frank was entitled to a civil penalty equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a penny stock bar. Frank also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement, which the court approved on August 25, 2016, required Frank to file a motion in the district court for a limited reopening of the case. Frank did not, and the court ultimately denied his motion. The SEC's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins Frank from participating in any class action proceeding and orders him to pay civil penalties of $100,000 or more. Frank has agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint. The final judgment also prohibits him from acting as an unregistered broker, dealer, or representative of a class in violation of the broker-dealer registration provisions of Rule 60(b)(1) and requires him to show cause why he should not participate in the settlement negotiations. Frank is also prohibited from associating with any broker or dealer who is not registered to sell a product or service to the class. The litigation against Frank is continuing.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, as well as the Division of Enforcement's Retail Strategy Task Force.
