  "summary": "On November 20, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine entered a final judgment in favor of Maine's Unified Special Education Regulation (IDEA). The court found that the IDEA requires states receiving federal special education funds to provide eligible children with a free appropriate public education, or FAPE, with a two-year statute of limitations. According to the court's order, filed in May 2013, Ms. S filed a due-process hearing request in August 2013 alleging that B.S.'s education in school years 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 and found no violations as to school years 2011-2012 and 2012-2013. The court also found that, contrary to the state's intent in designing MUSER, she failed to file an application for the exemption because she did not know or should have known about the requirements of the federal statute.  The court's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins the state from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 1415(b)(6)(B) of the I.D. Education Act, and orders states to adopt a \"look-back term\" and filing limitation.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Western District of New York today announced criminal charges against Ms. Suh. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Marc Blau of the SEC's Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Education, and the Maine Department of Health and Human Services."
