  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against JK Moving & Storage, Inc., a Virginia-based moving and storage corporation, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 13b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on October 12, 2017, Winmar was hired to renovate the Washington Reagan National Airport Hotel and its furniture was moved from Arlington, Va. to Sterling, Virginia.  The complaint alleges that JK moving damaged sixteen pieces of furniture and converted thirteen pieces of the furniture, and that the contracts are void because they are not subject to the federal district court's jurisdiction.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia announced criminal charges against Winmar.  On November 7, 2018, the Court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered Winmar to comply with the court's order and to pay a civil penalty of $50,000.  Winmar has agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, and to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of $55,000, prejudgment interest of $2,038, and a civil monetary penalty equal to the amount of the settlement amount.  J.K. Moving's settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1391(a).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Marc Blau. The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau and Ms. Berry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Virginia Attorney General's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
