  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee today entered a final judgment against three convicted murderers in a parallel criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Memphis, Tennessee, alleges that Billy Ray Irick and two other convicted murderers violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to adequately demonstrate that the three-drug protocol constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the federal and Tennessee constitutions.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants did not adequately disclose to the trial court that the drug pentobarbital was not available for use in executions.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the Defendants failed to show that the one-drug method of execution is a reasonable alternative, and that they failed to demonstrate that there was any risk of severe pain associated with the use of the drug.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar against them. The court also granted the defendants' motion for an expedited hearing to determine whether to issue an order appointing a receiver to oversee the execution of Irick.  On May 21, 2018, the court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered the defendants to comply with the court's order.  A hearing scheduled for June 1, 2018 is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Tennessee Department of Corrections, and the Tennessee State Corporation Commission in this matter."
