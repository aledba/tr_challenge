  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Virginia man who was convicted of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleges that Ryan Austin Collins, a resident of Alexandria, Va., violated Section 5 of the federal securities laws by entering the curtilage of a home without a search warrant. According to the complaint, the officer followed the car into the garage and searched it. The complaint further alleges that, at the time of the search, a reasonably well-trained officer would not have known that the automobile exception did not permit him to search a vehicle parked in the driveway of a private home. In addition, the complaint alleges that the officers followed the vehicle into the open garage, which is where the car was located, without any reasonable expectation of reasonable detection. The SEC also alleges that Officer Rhodes violated Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and Section 15(a)(2) of Rule 15a-3 thereunder of the Exchange Act. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The court also granted the defendants the right to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Virginia today announced criminal charges against Collins.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Paul G. G. Sansone of the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering an asset freeze and other emergency relief. The order also imposed a $25,000 civil penalty against Collins for his participation in the alleged conduct.  According to a complaint filed in the U. S. District court for the Eastern District of Washington, the court found that the unreasonable search and seizure exception applies when a reasonable person has reasonable reasonable suspicion of a reasonable violation of the Fourth Amendment. The Court also ordered the officer to comply with a court order requiring him to provide a copy of the court order, which was issued in the course of the investigation. The officer complied with the order, and the court granted the officer's request for a temporary injunction and a temporary officer-and-director bar. The investigation was conducted by Jennifer C. McKinley and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by"
