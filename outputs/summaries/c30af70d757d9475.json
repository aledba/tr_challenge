  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against a Fredericksburg man who was found guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the defendant and ordered him to surrender his passport.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Richmond, Virginia, the defendant tested positive for cocaine in April 2009 and admitted having used the drug four days earlier. The court found that the defendant had absconded from supervision and had been sentenced to a total of twenty years in prison with fourteen years suspended. The SEC alleges that the defendants had been arrested on new felony charges, which the court found to be consistent with the allegations in the 2010 report.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, based on the defendant\u2019s admission of guilt at the time of the revocation proceeding, he had been previously suspended for violating the terms and conditions of his suspended sentence.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $150,000.  On a related administrative proceeding, the court granted the SEC request for an asset freeze against the defendants and ordered the defendants to surrender their passport and return to the United States.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Compliance and Assessments with the assistance of the Virginia Office of Inspector General and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Jospin, and the case is being supervised by Jennifer C. McKinley.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the Virginia Attorney General's Office."
