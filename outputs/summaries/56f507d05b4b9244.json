  "summary": "On February 27, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a final judgment against Dalton K. Crowe, a Lima, Ohio man who was charged with a felony for his role in an April 3, 2018 stabbing of Joshua McPheron.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Ohio, Crowe was arrested on April 4, 2018, while under the influence of a deadly weapon, a steak knife, during a second physical confrontation with Joshua.  The complaint alleges that Crowe used the steak knife to stab Joshua, who was standing next to him on the couch.  As alleged in the complaint, after Joshua confronted Crowe with the knife, the two began to argue about whether the knife should be used to defend themselves.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Crowe.  On January 8, 2020, the court entered a judgment ordering a temporary restraining order, freezing Crowe's assets, and ordering a conduct-based injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering Crowe to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil penalty of three years and a $1,000,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil monetary penalty of $2,500, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of a public company or a private company, and requires him to provide a copy of the complaint to the court.  Additionally, the judgment orders Crowe not to participate in any securities offering or solicitation of any offer of securities, and prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a publicly-traded company or association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio State Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio Department of Justice."
