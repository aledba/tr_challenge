  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New Jersey announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against a defendant for violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, alleges that the New Jersey Attorney General's Office (AGO) issued a series of false and misleading statements to the court in connection with the solicitation of a plea agreement that would reduce the mandatory minimum sentence for a defendant to a minimum of twenty-five years.  According to the complaint, the AGO's false statements and misleading representations resulted in the imposition of a mandatory minimum of fifteen years of incarceration and a twenty-year period of parole ineligibility for certain drug-related offenses.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in response to a complaint by a defendant who had previously been convicted of first-degree aggravated sexual assault of a child less than thirteen years of age, the Attorney General issued plea agreements that waived, or did not waive, the statutory parole disqualifier.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, a $25,000 civil penalty, and a $10,000 officer-and-director bar.  On May 29, 2014, the Honorable Kathleen L. Gibson of the U.N. District Court for the Northern Districts of New York issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order against the defendant and ordering him to comply with the court's order. The order also requires the defendant to provide a statement of reasons for why he or she should not be sentenced pursuant to the JLA, and that the judge should determine whether to impose a penalty based on the severity of the alleged harm to the victim and her immediate family. The court also ordered the judge to provide an accounting of the amount of time that a defendant has already served as a result of his or her conviction for a prior felony conviction.  Finally, the court agreed to the issuance of an order requiring the prosecutor to provide to the sentencing court a written statement explaining the departure from the mandatory sentencing provisions of the federal sentencing laws, and to the appointment of a receiver to determine the appropriate amount of prison time for the defendant. The Court also granted the motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) and the pre-judgmental ordering of a criminal trial. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No."
