The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that C.T., a Louisiana resident, was falsely told in closing arguments that he was going to be a \"whole person\" when, in fact, he was not a whole person. The complaint further alleges that defendant told his mother that he wanted to be \"more like his mother and grandmother\" and that he did not want to have a \"whooping.\" The complaint also alleges that while he was in bed with his mother, D.A. told her that he had put his \"private part\" in her butt on more than one occasion, and that when she confronted him about it, he replied, \"you want to know what he didn't do, he never shook his head no.\" The SEC alleges that the defendant was lying when he told her he had gotten a whooping.

Investors can also use\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov to quickly and easily identify people who are vulnerable to investment fraud.
