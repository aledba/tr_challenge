  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio yesterday entered a final judgment against Manley Architecture Group, LLC and its general contractor, Steven Santanello, for breach of contract.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 22, 2004, Manley, a resident of Ohio, entered into a written contract governing the design and construction of a 5,800 square foot home for an estimated total cost of $1.6 million.  The court found that the contract required Manley to perform the work as a \"construction manager,\" which included monitoring the progress of the home's construction.  In addition, the court ruled that Manley had to pay $55,577.68 in fees to subcontractors for the work that was not performed by him.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Manly agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $64,270.68. The judgment also prohibits Manley from acting as a guarantor of the work performed by others, and bars him from participating in the construction management of a building.  Manley also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay civil penalties of $82,756.68 and $160,000, respectively. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Judgment No. 1345.01 et seq. (Dec. 22, 2016).
