  "summary": "On May 3, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana entered a final judgment against a former employee of Causin, L.L.C. d/b/a Bayou Safety and Supply, alleging that he violated the terms of a noncompete agreement signed during his employment with the company.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, Louisiana, on April 7, 2017, the former vice president of operations of Bayou and Supply of Plaquemines Parish, Texas, Jay R. Baker, was presented with the Non-Compete Document, which stated that the company was engaged in the highly competitive business of selling cylinder gases, compressed gases, welding supplies, safety supplies, and parts thereof.  The complaint alleges that Baker did not agree to the non-compete document, and that he was not bound by the requirements of the agreement.  As a result, the complaint alleges, Baker was not able to participate in the business in which he was barred from competing and soliciting.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Baker.  On May 3rd, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Baker, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Baker consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078.95 plus prejudgment interest of $2,077.95 and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Baker also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for two years from the date of his termination.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the New Orleans Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Louisiana Secretary of State's Office, and the Louisiana Attorney General's Office in this matter."
