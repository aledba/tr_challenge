  "summary": "On May 19, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia entered a final judgment against the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEDQ) for violating the federal securities laws.  The court found that the DEDQ violated the antifraud provisions of Section 401 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, and 13b-11 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Richmond, Virginia, the Department of Energy (DIE) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had concluded that certain of the above-mentioned requirements were reasonable and sufficient to protect water quality in Virginia and West Virginia.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in 2016, the DIE issued an order requiring DIE to submit a \"reasonable assurance\" that all of its requirements would be met.  DIE also found that DIE had failed to adequately evaluate DIE\u2019s compliance with certain of those requirements.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, DIE has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins DIE from future violations of the securities laws, and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.  Additionally, the court has ordered MVP to provide an accounting of its progress in its litigation against DIE, which is continuing.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner and Kurt L. Gottschall of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Virginia Office of Environmental Education and the Federal Office of Inspector General."
