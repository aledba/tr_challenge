  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of aggravated domestic battery and sentenced to 30 months' probation.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that defendant Daniel Gleich was a \"pretty social\" couple who socialized frequently with friends and family members.  According to the complaint, on September 8, 2013, defendant and his then-wife, Maura Gavin, were at a benefit party with friends when defendant began acting out his nightmares. The complaint alleges that the next morning, defendant confronted his wife and told her that he was in the midst of a nightmare triggered by PTSD and that he had hit his wife in the head while she was lying in bed.  As alleged, defendant replied, \"Dan, it's me. It's me.\"  The complaint further alleges that when confronted by his wife, she replied, \u201cI'm fine.\u201d  The following morning, after she confronted defendant about his actions, defendant allegedly confronted her about them, telling her that she had no recollection of what had occurred the previous night and that she should check herself out.  He also allegedly told his wife that he \"wasn't asleep when he attacked his wife\" and that \"his act of falling on her and breaking her arm was an involuntary act for which he cannot be held accountable.\"  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against defendant.  On September 13, 2014, the District Court entered a temporary restraining order against defendant and ordered him to be enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws, entered a conduct-based injunction, and ordered defendant to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of these provisions, and orders him to pay a $2,500 civil penalty, and bars him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In related criminal proceedings, the SEC also instituted a related administrative proceeding against defendant on September 12, 2013. The SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office, and was supervised by Jennifer C."
