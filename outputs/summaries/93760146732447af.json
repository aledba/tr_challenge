  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (\"Sunrise\"), a California-based residential care facility for the elderly, for the wrongful death of Margaret Barcenas.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Las Vegas, Nevada, alleges that, in 2010, Daniels signed an agreement to arbitrate medical malpractice and wrongful death claims as the successor in interest of her late mother, who died as a result of inadequate care at Sunrise.  According to the complaint, Daniels agreed to the arbitration without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint to the court.  Daniels also agreed to arbitration in her personal capacity and to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Daniels.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Daniels violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 1295 and 1295 of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 12a-1, 12b2-3, and 13a-13 thereunder.   The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  On May 2, 2019, the U. S. District Judge for the Central District of Nevada entered a temporary restraining order against Daniels and ordered her to surrender her passport and other documents related to the settlement of her wrongful death.  After the settlement was announced, Daniels and her family filed a civil injunctive action against Sunrise, alleging that Daniels violated Section 1295, and that she violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of Exchange Act Rule 12b3-1.  Without admitting or denied the allegations, Daniels consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay $1.5 million in civil penalties, including $500,000 in restitution, and bars her from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Additionally, the court granted the family's request for an asset freeze and an officer-and-director bar against Daniels, and ordered the family to pay civil penalties of $1 million, $100,000, and $250,000.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Basinger in the Los Angeles Regional Office."
