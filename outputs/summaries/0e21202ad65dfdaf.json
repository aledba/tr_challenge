Braunstein and Susan Ann Stark for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, on April 11, 2012, the court entered a judgment in a civil injunctive action against David, ordering him to pay $125,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to 50% of the total net proceeds of any prospective foreclosure sale of a commercial property.

Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay civil penalties of $250,000 each, and requires them to provide for a conduct-based injunction against further violations of the charged sections of the securities laws. The court also granted the estate's request for a preliminary injunction against David's entry of an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver's real estate, and ordered the receiver to pay an amount equal to his or her annual income.
