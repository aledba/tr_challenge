  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was convicted of second degree assault for punching a man in the face during a bar fight.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, Tresco told the court that he had filed a grievance against his public defender because he lacked confidence in her representation and because he wanted to turn his life around.  The complaint alleges that the court failed to consider the nature of the alleged misconduct, the defendant\u2019s lack of remorse, his lack of trust in his counsel, and the interests of deterring crime and protecting the public.  In its judgment, the court found that the defendant violated his right to the assistance of counsel by failing to adequately consider evidence of his prior gang affiliation, including video clips from a 2010 episode of Gangland in which he discussed his membership in the North Side Mafia.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars in the amount of $1,000,000.    The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and Eric R. Werner of the SEC Enforcement Division's Denver Regional Office, with assistance from John R. Rymas of the Division of Criminal Justice. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
