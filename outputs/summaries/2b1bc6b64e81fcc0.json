  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a motion for reconsideration of a judgment that, in pertinent part, terminated her ex-husband, defendant Gary Zak's, alimony obligation, denied plaintiff's request for $'7600 per month in counsel fees under the parties' 2009 Property Settlement Agreement (PSA), and denied defendant's motion for a temporary suspension of his alimony obligations.  The court also found that defendant failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his request for a hearing to determine if a plenary hearing was necessary.  According to the court's order, filed on April 29, 2016, the court found that, based on the facts presented in the defendants' original and supplemental certifications, that defendant was entitled to a full payment of the amount due to him by the time he reached the retirement age of sixty-six.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, which was filed in federal district court in New Jersey, the Court held that defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the court had the power to determine whether to grant or deny a motion to revoke or suspend defendant's right to a hearing or any other determination of the merits of the case.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Zak.
