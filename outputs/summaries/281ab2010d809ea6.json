  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant for violating the federal supervised release provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Tyrone Thomas, who was previously incarcerated on a federal drug distribution charge, began drinking alcohol socially, mainly in the form of beer, in the days leading up to his release from prison.  As alleged in the complaint, Thomas had a history of substance abuse, including smoking marijuana and addiction to painkillers and heroin.  The complaint alleges that Thomas was a member of a street gang that used marijuana to support a drug and alcohol addiction.  In addition to his drug use, Thomas allegedly purchased and sold heroin from members of the gang for his own use.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Thomas consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the mandatory and standard conditions of supervised release, and orders him to pay a penalty of five months incarceration and two years supervised release.  Thomas has also agreed to be barred from serving any prison term for a period of five years.  On October 17, 2018, the court granted a temporary restraining order against Thomas and ordered him to comply with the court's order, which also prohibits him from participating in any supervised release program, including participating in a drug treatment program, or participating in an alcohol-related program.  To learn more about supervised release and how to avoid it, see Press Release Release No. 567 (Jan. 7, 2018).  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Mark T. Berg and Beth M. Huebner of the New York Regional Office, and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson and Glenn S. Gordon of the Division of Justice's Criminal Justice Division.
