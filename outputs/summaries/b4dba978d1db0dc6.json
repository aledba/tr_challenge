According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans on June 7, 2017, the defendants agreed to settle the litigation by agreeing to be enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,614,941.69, representing past due rent and damages.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Moore and supervised by Scott A. Thompson of the SEC Enforcement Division's New Orleans Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Moore, Ms. Anderson, and Ms. Thompson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Compliance in this matter."
