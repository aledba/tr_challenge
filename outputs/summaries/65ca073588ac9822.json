  "summary": "On January 15, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Mississippi entered an order denying Sims's claims for workers' compensation benefits.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Marty Sims was employed as a traveling salesman for Delta Fuel when he was injured in an October 2016 motor vehicle accident.  According to the complaint, Sims was on a two-day business mission when the accident occurred.  On October 21, 2016, Sims and his brother, Rodney Sims, were involved in an automobile accident that resulted in Sims\u2019s injuries.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, the accident and subsequent medical issues arose out of and in the course and scope of his employment.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Mid-Mississippi Division of Criminal Justice today announced criminal charges against Sims.   The complaint further alleges that Sims and Rodney Sims made sales calls at Howard Transportation in Ellisville, Mississippi and Cliburn Tank Lines in Florence, Mississippi.  After the accident, Sims sought medical treatment at the MEA Clinic in Mississippi, and on his way home from the event, he was involved in a motor vehicle crash.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Sims consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Sims also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively.  Additionally, Sims agreed to a bar prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offer of securities in the public company or by association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  To settle the SEC case, Sims will be required to show cause and manner of his injury, including whether he has had sufficient medical treatment to determine whether he is entitled to benefits under the federal securities laws.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (March 20, 2018).  The Commission's order also prohibits Sims from associating with anyone who has suffered a serious injury with the SEC, including his brother Rodney, as a result of his participation in a fraudulent scheme"
