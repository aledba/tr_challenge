  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio yesterday entered a final judgment against Danny Lee Hill, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for orchestrating a string of high-level criminal charges.  The court found that Hill violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, Hill, who was a resident of Warren, Ohio, was unlawfully prevented from filing a motion for a new trial by the Trumbull County Prosecutor's Office.  Hill's motion was filed on the basis of newly discovered bite mark evidence, and Hill agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and requires him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In its order, the court also imposed a temporary restraining order, which prohibits Hill from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, including securities in exchange for a share of the proceeds of any sales of the securities.  On October 26, 2016, the Honorable Paul E. Rymas granted Hill's request for a hearing on the merits of his motion for new trial, without admitting or denying the allegations of the court, and ordered Hill to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and a $20,000 officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denied the allegations in the court order, however, Hill consented to the entry of a final judgement that permanently restrains the judgment against him, permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains, and orders a conduct-based injunction against further violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933, and requires Hill to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The final judgment also orders that Hill pay a penalty of $25,000, which is equal to the amount of restitution he has already paid to the victims of the earlier criminal charges he has been convicted of.  Additionally, Hill has agreed to be permanently enjoined from associating with any third party who is not a registered representative of the district attorney's office, and to pay civil penalties of $50,000 and $10 million, respectively, for each of his prior criminal convictions.  Finally, the Court granted Hill the right to a hearing and to appoint a receiver for the receiver of the receiver's receiver.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5,"
