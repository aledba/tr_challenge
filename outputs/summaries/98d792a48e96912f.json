  "summary": "On February 14, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana entered a final judgment against Nova Tube, Inc., a Kentucky-based real estate developer, and its auditor in a case that was handled by the Indiana Board of Assessors.  The court found that Nova Tube violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to provide market-based evidence that the property was overvalued when it was sold in May 2014.  According to the court's order, Nova Tube also failed to show that the May 2014 sale price was sufficiently related to the market value of the property.  Nova Tube's complaint, filed in federal district court in Indianapolis, alleges that the Assessor failed to adequately demonstrate to the Board that she was atypical in her determination of the value of a property and that she did not trend that sale and affirmatively link the sales price to the valuation dates at issue.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court granted Nova Tube the right to return a judgment that permanently enjoins Nova Tube from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Nova Tube to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $2.9 million, $3.1 million, and $3,100,000, respectively, to be determined by the court at a later date.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Kentucky today announced criminal charges against the company.

Dumornay. The case is being supervised by Jan Folena. The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Indiana Attorney General's Office, and the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office."
