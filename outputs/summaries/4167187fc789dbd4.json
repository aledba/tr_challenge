  "summary": "On January 9, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment against the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b)(2)(i) and (c) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, charges the Secretary with violating the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b-11 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In its complaint, the SEC also alleges that the Secretary misstated the number of days of dual-eligible exhausted days in the Medicare fraction, thereby depriving affected hospitals of fair notice and the ability to submit comments.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Secretary has consented to the entry of a final rule that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-221 (January 19, 2018).  The complaint also seeks a temporary restraining order, an injunction, and an order freezing the assets of the defendants, and a penny stock bar against the defendants.  To learn more about administrative rules violations, see Rule 17a-1 and Rule 10b2-2 thereunder; and to learn how to spot and prevent them from appearing or appearing before the SEC as part of a case that is being handled by the SEC.  On May 19, 2004, the D.C. Circuit Court entered an order ordering the SEC to conduct an independent review of the effectiveness of the proposed rule, which was conducted by the Office of Inspector General and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
