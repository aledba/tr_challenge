  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against E.M.E., Inc., a family-owned metal finishing company based in Compton, California, for violations of the Labor Code, Industrial Welfare Commission's Wage Order No. 1\u20132001, and the unfair competition law.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, filed on August 16, 2013, E. M.E. and its founder and chairman, Wesley Turnbow, raised the issue of whether the company's rest break schedules complied with the IWC's wage order.  The complaint alleges that, in reality, the rest break schedule was not feasible for most workers.  In addition, as alleged in the complaint, when an employer requires a rest break in an eight-hour shift, it requires a 10-minute rest break before and after the meal break.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the company and Turnbow consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2017.  This case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov. Investors can quickly and easily check the background of anyone selling investments by using the Investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-14 thereunder by failing to provide sufficient time to prepare for a meal or rest break, and failing to comply with Section 12(a) of Wage Order 1-2001. The complaint further alleges that defendants violated Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(c) of that order, and that they violated Sections 206(1), 206(2)(B) and 206(3) of those orders.  As a result, the complaint seeks summary judgment against defendants, permanent injunctions against future violations, and a civil penalty against each of them.   In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Turnbow. "
