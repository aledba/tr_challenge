  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Stacey Carlson (Stacey) and Gabriel Ashlock (Gabriel), both of whom claimed entitlement to the estate of Gabriel's deceased father.  The court found Stacey liable under Section 859 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 for misappropriating a diamond ring valued at $10,000.  According to the court's order, Stacey was found liable under section 859 for a total of $11.9 million, which represents twice the value of the property recovered in the action.  In addition, the court found that Stacey had forged documents purporting to show the creation, in 2009, of the Little Hills Ranch and Investwest Properties partnerships.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the judgment, the Court held that neither Stacey nor Gabriel had acted in bad faith in the setting up of the partnerships, and that neither of them were liable for double damages.  Stacey and Gabriel have agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of judgments that impose permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,677,554.

The court also granted Stacey's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against her from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for July 13, 2018, for which Stacey consented to a judgment enjoining her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering her to return $27,624.20 to a court-appointed representative of the estate, and imposing a $1.6 million civil penalty against Gabriel for the same amount of property recovered by Stacey.  An SEC order appointing a receiver for the estate was also ordered by the court to determine whether to issue an order requiring the receiver to return the property to the person who is liable for the property recoverable under the provision of section 850, and to pay statutory double damages of $394,804. The SEC's order also requires the receiver return $365,152.92 to"
