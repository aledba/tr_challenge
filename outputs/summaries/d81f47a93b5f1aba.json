  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Kahwahnas Potts, a Michigan resident who was sentenced to nine years in prison for aggravated identity theft.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, Potts violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Potts agreed to settle the case by agreeing to a nine-year prison sentence and to be barred from the federal district court system for five years.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  In its judgment, the court found that Potts had covered his tracks and failed to consider the relevant factors in determining whether to run multiple aggravated-identity theft sentences consecutively.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Court also ordered Potts to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar, and to pay an $80,000 penalty.  To settle the matter, the judge agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Potts from future violations of the federal securities laws, imposes a five-year suspended prison sentence, and imposes a six-year bar on Potts.  On January 2, 2019, the Honorable Paul G. Sansone of the United States District Court in the Eastern District of Michigan entered a judgment against Potts that permanently bars him from serving any prison term longer than five years, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his prison time.  At the time of his sentencing, the district court had discretion to impose a four-year suspension for Potts based on the nature and seriousness of the underlying offense, and he had not yet served his prison sentence.  As a result of the court\u2019s decision to impose the suspension, the sentence was imposed consecutively, for a total of four years, without prejudice to Potts and Sansone, who was previously sentenced to prison terms ranging from one year to two years. The court also imposed a five year suspension for potts based upon the severity of his prior felony convictions.  It also imposed an additional nine months of supervised release.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, and the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California."
