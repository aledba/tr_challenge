  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against Universal Underwriters Insurance Company, Inc., a Kentucky-based insurance company, in a related administrative proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kentucky, alleges that Universal violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, Messer, who worked for Mountain Ford, Inc. detailing vehicles in preparation for sale to the public, received a letter from a representative of Taylor's supervisor stating that Taylor was driving Mountain Ford's vehicle with permission. The letter further alleged that, after learning from Taylor that Taylor had used Mountain Ford\u2019s vehicle on the night of the accident, Mountain Ford agreed to pay $500,000 to settle the matter. The complaint further alleges that Messer submitted a second letter to Taylor stating that he had \"undervalued\" the vehicle and that he drove the vehicle home on the date in question.  In a parallel action, the Kentucky Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Messer.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Universal agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of its insured's ill-gotten gains. The judgment also prohibits Universal from denying or denying Messer's claims for a third-party insurance policy, and requires it to show that it has reasonable basis in law and fact for denying the insurer's liability for the accident.  Messer also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On May 2, 2016, the court granted Universal's motion for summary judgment and ordered Messer to submit a motion for partial summary judgment, which is subject to court approval. The court also granted Universal a temporary restraining order, which prohibits Messer from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any insurance policy. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
