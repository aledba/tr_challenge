  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against COSCO Shipping Lines North America, Inc., a Chicago-based shipping company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, Torzewski, a resident of Secaucus, Illinois, alleges that, in May 2017, COSco terminated him for failing to accommodate his request to work from Chicago.  The complaint further alleges that in August 2017, Torziak showed up drunk to a sales conference in Houston, Texas and was sent back to Chicago to begin in-patient treatment for alcohol dependence.  As alleged in the complaint, after Torzak requested to return to work, he was told that his position had been relocated to New Jersey and that he would have to move to a different state if he wanted to be reinstated to work.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the Complaint alleges that Torzek violated the anti-fraud provision of the federal employee benefit law, Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206 of 1940.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Torzik.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David P. Kelly and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by Mr. Kelly. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
