  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Maryland announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against the Maryland Department of Environmental Quality (DOE) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Maryland, alleges that the Maryland DOE violated the federal securities laws by failing to include certain criteria in its discharge permit applications, including that the DOE does not require that a particular pollutant be removed from a discharge permit. The complaint also alleges that, contrary to the DoE's representations, the Department did not consider the impervious surface restoration requirement in its permit application as a reasonable measure of compliance with water quality standards, and that it did not apply to all point sources of water pollution.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Maryland did not meet its obligations under the federal law when it issued its discharge permits to certain point sources.  According to the complaint, Frederick County failed to comply with the requirements of the federal permit, which requires that all point source permits be subject to the same minimum level of control that is required by the rule, and failed to consider the impact on the water quality of those point sources on the county's water quality.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Maryland and Maryland have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the charged federal laws, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The SEC also has agreed to pay an $80,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1342 (January 14, 2019).  The Commission's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint also seeks an injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Maryland and Frederick County, as well as an officer-and-director bar against Frederick County. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Maryland Office of Environmental Education, and the Maryland Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
