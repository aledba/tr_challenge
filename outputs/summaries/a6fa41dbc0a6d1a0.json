  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a Tennessee-based father and his wife, who are currently living in New York.  According to the court's order, filed on June 14, 2013, the husband and wife filed a verified complaint for divorce in Monroe County, Tenn., alleging that the wife and her current boyfriend have engaged in demeaning conduct toward the child, the child is academically behind her grade level, the mother inconsistently administered needed medications to the child and that the child's education would be improved by transfer to a Monroe County-based school district.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the husband from further violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its order, the court entered an order granting the husband the right to return the child to his wife and to appoint an attorney for the child.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the father and wife have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering the husband to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  On August 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Burt of the U.N. District Judge's Office issued an order suspending the pending action against the father.  A hearing scheduled for September 5, 2018 will be conducted by Jennifer C. Barry and Glenn S. Gordon, with the assistance of the Office of the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Tennessee.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 539 (A&E.2d 539).  The Court granted the wife's request for a temporary injunction against further violations of Section 506 of the Exchange Act and Rule 508-8 thereunder, and appointed an attorney to assist her in this matter.  An SEC order appointing an attorney will be instituted upon motion by the court upon motion of the court.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Thompson, Ms. Gibson, and Mr. Gordon. The case is being supervised by Janie C. Haiman. The SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Richard A. Kasper of the Philadelphia Regional Office, and the case was supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis."
