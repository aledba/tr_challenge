  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Duke Energy Ohio, Inc. (\"Duke\"), a public-utility corporation based in Ohio, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, Duke Energy's exclusive-right claim for service exclusivity is based on the Ohio Certified Territories Act and tariffs filed with the federal government.  The complaint alleges that Duke Energy violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose that it had an exclusive right to provide electric and natural gas services within the 209-acre area of Fairfield Township, Ohio.  Duke Energy also alleges that the federal district court in Dayton, Ohio improperly granted Duke Energy a partial judgment granting it the right to refile the complaint without subject matter jurisdiction.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action, charging Duke Energy with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 10(b) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rules 5b-5, 5a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder, and ordering Duke Energy to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  On May 1, 2017, the court granted the parties' motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties of $100,000 each.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael R. Kasper and supervised by Lara S. Mehraban of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio Department of Commerce. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
