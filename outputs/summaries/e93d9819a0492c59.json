  "summary": "On August 1, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against a Pennsylvania State Trooper who was suspended for refusing to submit to a blood test.  The court found that the trooper violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1547 of the Vehicle Code.  According to the court's order, on November 12, 2014, while on patrol, he observed a Nissan Maxima fail to stop at a red light. The court ruled that the driver could not be deemed to have consented to a chemical test because he \"[had] a phobia for needles.\" The court also ruled that a search warrant should not be required before a driver can submit to such a test, and that an officer could not impose civil penalties on a driver who refused to submit.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, the trooper agreed to a one-year suspension of his operating privilege and to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation today announced that it has suspended Licensee from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any automobile. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, charges Licensee with violating the federal securities laws and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The complaint also seeks an officer-and-director bar against Licensee, and a penny stock bar against him.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1547(b)(1).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office in this matter."
