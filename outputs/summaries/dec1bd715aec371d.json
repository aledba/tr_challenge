  "summary": "On May 2 and 3, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against Cummins Allison Corporation (Cummins) for breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets, conversion, and tortious interference.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, alleges that Arkeyo, a Pennsylvania-based company, created software that integrates with coin counting machines. According to the complaint, the software was publicly available on the internet for fifteen months without being publicly disclosed to the public. The complaint further alleges that the software did not have any security features and was not available for download onto any computer. The SEC alleges that, in addition to being publicly available, the complaint alleges that it published the software on its website without taking any reasonable precautions to protect the confidentiality of the trade secrets.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Arkeyos.  On May 2, 2017 the U District Court entered a preliminary injunction against the company from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, entered a cease-and-desist order, and entered an order freezing the assets of the company and prohibiting them from being used for any purpose other than to facilitate the purchase, sale, or promotion of a product or service.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the company consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 4, 2017).  The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, and Kelly L. Gibson, Regional Director of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Pennsylvania Department of Commerce, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
