  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment in favor of a Florida man who was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that, on November 5, 2005, Joe Bradley and Manny Quintero agreed to meet at an apartment complex to discuss jewelry and money that Joe allegedly stole. The complaint alleges that Allen failed to raise the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel when he failed to move for a judgment of acquittal on the same charge.  According to the complaint, Allen then emerged from a nearby car and fired at the men, causing them to stop fighting and start running away.  As alleged, Allen continued firing, causing Joe to recover after several months in the hospital.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Florida today announced criminal charges against Allen arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On March 14, 2011, Allen, while proceeding pro se, filed a second motion for relief under Rule 3.850, alleging that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the court\u2019s justifiable use of a deadly force jury instruction.  Allen was found guilty on all counts, including, but not limited to: (1) the amount of money Allen allegedly stole, (2) the number of victims, (3) the severity of the injuries, (4) the manner in which Allen caused the death, (5) the nature of the injury, (6) the cause of his death, and (7) the effect of his misconduct on the fairness and reliability of his convictions and sentence.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Allen consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, Inc. (Advisers), and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The court also granted Allen a temporary restraining order, barring him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, and from making any offer to purchase or sell any security in connection with the issuance of any security, including the right to reapply as a free and simple citizen.  It also ordered Allen to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $500,000 officer and director bar.   The court agreed to the settlement without prejudice"
