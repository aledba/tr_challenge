  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against John R. Trotter II, M.D., Medical Services, PLLC, and Elaine L. Lovett, a medical billing services company owner, in a fraud case brought by the Department of Justice.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, from 2007 through 2008, Trotters and Lovett engaged in a two-phase conspiracy to defraud Medicare by billing for services that were not performed at their clinics, including nerve blocks that were never performed. The complaint alleges that the defendants billed for nerve blocks in the name of a doctor and a few patients, and that they did not perform any nerve blocks. The SEC alleges that, contrary to what the defendants told the court, the defendants charged each of them with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the books and records and records provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4), and the broker-dealer registration provisions of the Exchange Act. The court also found that, based on the defendants\u2019 inconsistent testimony, they should not have been permitted to testify.  The SEC\u2019s complaint against the defendants charges, which was filed in the United States District Court in Manhattan, charges them with violations of the federal securities laws. The defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against each of the defendants.  Among other things, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar against each defendant.
