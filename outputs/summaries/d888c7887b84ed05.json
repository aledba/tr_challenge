  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida today entered a final judgment in favor of transferring a subpoena dispute to the court where it will be handled.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Miami, Florida, on July 22, 2016, a federal judge issued a subpoena to a Maryland-based optometrist who requested that the subpoena be issued in a district where compliance with the subpoena is required.  The subpoena was issued pursuant to Rule 45(f) of the federal securities laws, and the court that issued the subpoena issued a temporary restraining order preventing the subpoena from being issued in the district where the subpoena was filed.  As alleged in the complaint, the subpoena violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1407 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 12b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, the court has consented to the transfer of the subpoena.  In a parallel action, on January 19, 2017, the United States Attorney's Office for Florida announced that it filed an emergency action and obtained an emergency court order freezing the assets of the subpoenaed individual and ordering them to pay a $1.2 million civil penalty.  On January 24, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the individual and a wholesaler, charging them with violating Rule 1407 and ordering the subpoena enforcement to be conducted by a court where compliance is required, including a district judge and magistrate judge.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit, with the assistance of trial counsel from the Division of Enforcement's Microcap Fraud Task Force. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals who are subject to subpoena requests.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the Office of Compliance and Regulatory Affairs has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Notice\u00c2\u00a0Complaint\u00c2\u00a0Issuing a Request for a Temporary Restraining Order (ORRA) to facilitate the issuance of a subpoena pursuant to the federal subpoena order.  For further information, see\u00c2\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commission Complaint Bulletin No. 5,\u00c2\u00a02014."
