  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment against Ricardo Harris, a convicted felon who was charged with concealing the death of his girlfriend.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that Harris violated the antifraud provisions of Section 24-1-103 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 24-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Harris was arrested on January 14, 2013, and was held in the same cell as his girlfriend, Yvonne James, who was also a victim of the alleged crime. Harris allegedly told his attorney that he wanted to make a statement about his girlfriend and that he would \"take a stab\" at the admission of her pre-trial statements.

Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Harris consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties of $15,000 and $20,000.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged scheme of a federal securities law violation.
