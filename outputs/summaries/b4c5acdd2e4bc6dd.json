  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on May 9, 2017, entered a final judgment against defendant Augustin Torres, Jr., who was convicted of first-degree murder in 1995 and sentenced to 50 years in prison.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Rock Island County, Illinois, Torres was the prime mover in a series of events in which two teenagers were attacked with a club.  The complaint alleges that Torres and another defendant, Craig Jordan, told Torres and Olvera that they were the \"prime mover\" behind the attack.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the defendants were not with the parties at the time of the attack, and the defendants had been pressuring Torres to become involved in activities that he did not wish to participate in.  Instead, the complaint alleges, defendants were simply walking home from the club when they realized they were being dragged down by their peers.  In a parallel action, the Illinois Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Torres.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Antoinette B. Holman of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Kelly B. Gibson under the supervision of Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Illinois Department of Justice Criminal Division's Office of Inspector General."
