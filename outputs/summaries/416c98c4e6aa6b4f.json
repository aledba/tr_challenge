  "summary": "On December 13, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Mercy Medical Center and its former CEO, Joel Yohai, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that, from approximately July 2007 to November 2007, the defendants made numerous public complaints about the quality of care at Mercy, including complaints of inappropriate entries in medical charts, failure to follow protocols, and repeated reports of interpersonal problems with staff and colleagues.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether the defendants were entitled to a qualified privilege of common interest.  According to the complaint, in addition to making false claims about the Quality of Care at Mercy that were not true, they also failed to disclose to the defendants that, despite prior warnings and opportunities to improve his problematic behavior, the plaintiff failed to do so.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  On May 18, 2010, the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment against the defendants and ordered them to return their allegedly defamatory statements to the court, which were deemed sufficient to warrant a judgment against them.  As a result of the court's order, Mercy has agreed to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221.  Separately, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the Defendants for their roles in the alleged misconduct.  This matter has been investigated by the Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Justice's Cyber Unit. The litigation will be led by Andrew Schiff and Mr. Schiff. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter, the New York State Attorney General's Office, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service (FINRA), and the Federal Office of the Secretary of State."
