  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment against Hashim Hamlett and his brother, Salim, in a case that was investigated by the Atlanta Regional Office.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that Hashim and Salim violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Hashim has agreed to settle the SEC's charges against him by agreeing to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal and Georgia securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. Hashim also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to a five-year officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Georgia today announced criminal charges against Salim.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Hashim, who lives in Buckhead Community Bank foreclosed on a home on Hill Forest Trail in 2009, was convicted of burglary and theft by taking in connection with a scheme to steal high-end appliances from vacant Cobb County homes. The SEC alleges that the defendants violated their constitutional rights by admitting that they were in possession of recently stolen items when they entered the home and removed a Wolf range from the property. The complaint also alleges that Salim lied to the trial court about the nature of the stolen items, and failed to show that he was a party to the crime.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants have consented to permanent injunctions, to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions, and to pay civil penalties of $15,000 and $20,000, respectively. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 24-4-404 (a) (b) (c) (3) (a)(1) and (3)-3(d) (2) (e) (1) (A) (B).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Atlanta Division of Criminal Investigations, and Amy C. Welshhans. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
