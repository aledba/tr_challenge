  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Minnesota today announced criminal charges against a Minnesota resident for his role in an alleged delay in approving a total maximum daily load (TMDL) for Crystal Lake, Minnesota.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Minnesota on August 27, 2012, Greg Mikkelson, a resident of Annandale, Minnesota, raised the issue of whether the Minnesota Department of Environmental Quality (MDPQ) required a separate load allocation for nonpoint sources and natural background in determining the TMDL.  The complaint alleges that the MDPQ's delay resulted in a denial of due process to relator, and that the decision was arbitrary and capricious.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Water Quality (OWQ) today announced that it has issued an order suspending the issuance of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the MPCA from violating its due-process rights and orders it to conduct a contested-case hearing on the matter.   The SEC's Complaint alleges that, contrary to the representations in the Complaint, the MMPCA failed to conduct testing recommended by its own guidance that would have allowed it to calculate natural background.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the Commission has agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion of the Commission. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's Office of Inspector General has also issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly and easily identify whether they are registered professionals."
