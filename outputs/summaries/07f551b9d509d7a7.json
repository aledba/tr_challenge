  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against a defendant-appellee who pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and endangering children in violation of the federal securities laws.  According to the court's order, in July 2008, Lynda Sykes was named in a single-count indictment, charging her with aggravated murder with a felony. The court found Sykes eligible for judicial release because, pursuant to her plea agreement, she was serving a mandatory prison term. Sykes agreed to serve a period of incarceration of 15 years, followed by a post-release control period. The judge also agreed to impose a 15-year prison term on Sykes.  The court also found that Sykes had a stellar prison record, and that she was entitled to judicial release under the terms of the plea agreement.  Sykes's plea agreement and agreed-upon sentence did not violate the mandatory prison terms by operation of law, and the court ultimately agreed to the mandatory release.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, Sykes consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a penalty equal to the amount of her sentence. The judgment also prohibits Sykes from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of a state or federal agency, including the right to reapply after five years of incarceration.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Sykes arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC's complaint. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Analysis and Detection of Criminal Justice. The case has been supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Amy C. McKinley."
