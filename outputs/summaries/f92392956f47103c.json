  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Utah today entered a final judgment against defendant Christopher James Bonds, Jr. on consent, finding that Bonds violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that Bonds, who lives in the same apartment complex as he and his wife, was falsely told by two officers that he had shot Victim in self-defense. Bonds allegedly told the officers that, right before the shooting, he had heard shots fired, and that he \"saw [victim] with a gun.\" Bonds also allegedly told one officer that he did not know who shot Victim and that, after he confronted the officer, he and the officer confronted Bonds about the shooting and he shot Victim several times. Bonds's wife, Girlfriend, and Girlfriend also allegedly confronted Bonds, telling him that they had \"heard shots fired\" and that \"nobody gonna hurt my kids.\" Bonds allegedly replied, \"I'm not going to tell you anything about that.\"  The court also found that Bonds failed to object to the use of the false friend technique, which is intended to induce a defendant to lie about the nature of the shooting.  Bonds also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Bonds.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed on May 24, 2019, the SEC obtained a temporary restraining order against Bonds and ordered him to return to his apartment. Bonds agreed to the order without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint. The court granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws, and ordered Bonds to pay disgorgement of $1,078.71, prejudgment interest of $2,038.81, and a $100,000 civil penalty. Bonds also consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay civil penalties of $150,000 and $75,000, respectively. Bonds has agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and to a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future. The settlement is subject to court approval."
