  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment against Ford Motor Company, Inc., a New Mexico-based microcap company, for violating the registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, alleges that Ford consented to general jurisdiction in violation of Section 53-17-11 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 50b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Ford agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the federal registration provisions and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Ford also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Ford has agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations and to a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New Mexico announced criminal charges against Ford.  On May 17, 2016, the federal district court in New Mexico issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering Ford to comply with the court's order.  This order, which is subject to court approval, orders Ford to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and bars him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  A hearing scheduled for May 24, 2018, is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Mexico Secretary of State's Office, and the Arizona Attorney General's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-11-2017."
