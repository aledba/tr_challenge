  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Orleans today entered a final judgment against the City of Orleans' Department of Public Works (DPW) for unlawfully terminating a former Parking Administrator.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Orleans, alleges that Zepporiah Edmonds was terminated by the DPW in August 2014.  According to the complaint, Ms. Edmonds filed two appeals with the Commission in 2015, alleging that she was unable or unwilling to cooperate with the investigation conducted by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG).  The complaint also alleges that Ms.Edmonds failed to provide the OIG with relevant information about her disciplinary history, including that she had been previously warned for similar conduct in the past.  In addition, the complaint alleges that she failed to comply with OIG's requests to remove her from her position as Parking Administrator, despite repeated requests to do so.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Edmonds agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay a civil penalty of $3,000/yr.  She also agreed to the appointment of a hearing examiner to determine the appropriate level of discipline for her.  On November 16, 2017, the Commission issued its final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions, and orders her to return to her duties as a parking administrator.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Mark Jernigan and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson, and the case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Department of Justice in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 10-2074 (January 11, 2019)."
