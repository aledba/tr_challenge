  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Jason Zank, a citizen of the United States, and Liz Lopez Moreno, an Ecuadorian citizen, in a related case.  The court found that Zank violated the Hague Convention, which requires the return of a child from an abduction to a country where the child has become accustomed to living.  According to the court's order, Zank failed to file a Hague Convention petition in violation of the provisions of the Convention.  Zank also failed to show that he was obstructed in his efforts to obtain permanent custody of BLZ in Ecuador.  In a parallel action, the U.N.

On August 10, 2016, the court granted Zank the right to return BLZ to Ecuador, without admitting or denying Zank\u2019s claims.

Finally, the Court found that in the case Zank did not have sufficient evidence to convince the court that he had acted in the best interest of the child when he was abducted from a previous residence, and therefore could not bring an action with the court there.  Further, the judgment also found Zank liable for violations of the Hague Rules of Practice, which require a court to determine whether a person has a legitimate right to a return of an abducted child from a foreign country, including one that is subject to the jurisdiction of the court. The court also ruled in favor of Zank in this matter, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and ordered him to sign a consent judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the international child abduction laws, and orders him to"
