  "summary": "On May 21, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a Texas-based health care company and its CEO for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal health care law.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that, from 1973 until 2008, the federal government issued a rule requiring health care providers to perform abortions and sterilizations.  According to the complaint, this rule violated the federal anti-discrimination provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the company and CEO consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions and orders them to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $10,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the company, its CEO, and a member of the board of directors of the company.
