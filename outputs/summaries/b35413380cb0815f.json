  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against CertusView Technologies, LLC and S&N Communications, Inc., in an action brought by S&n Communications alleging that it violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, from at least 2012 through 2013, certusView asserted, among other things, that its patents covered an abstract idea that could be used to document a locate operation.  According to the complaint, however, the SEC's finding that the patents were not eligible for patent eligibility was unreasonable because, as alleged in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the court found that the claims in the complaint were objectively unreasonable because they were based on the same principles as those at issue in Bilski and Mayo.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint or the Court's order, Certusview consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties that will be imposed upon each defendant.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Patent and Trademark Regulation today announced that it has issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of all defendants, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty.  On May 29, 2016, the Court granted the SEC and Exchange Act's request for an emergency asset freeze and ordered a hearing on the merits of the case.  Following the court's order granting the SEC preliminary injunction, S &n filed a motion for an expedited hearing on June 1, 2015, and a request for a preliminary injunction on June 15, 2016.   The court granted the request for emergency asset freezes and other emergency relief. \u00c2\u00a0On July 5, 2017, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued an order suspending the issuance of a temporary injunction, ordering a hearing to determine whether to proceed with the litigation, and ordering an injunction against further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and ordering the SEC to conduct an independent examination of the patents and determine whether they are eligible for a permanent injunction.\u00c2\u00a0The court also issued an Order suspending the issuing of an injunction, freezing all defendants' assets, and issuing an order appointing a receiver"
