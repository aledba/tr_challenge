  "summary": "On June 20, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Ohio entered a final judgment against Glen P. Stewart, the former mayor of Ashland, for his role in a 2015 automobile accident that injured a third person.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the Ashland County Court of Common Pleas, Stewart was the named insured on an automobile liability insurance policy issued by Defendant-Appellee Cincinnati Insurance Company. The policy provided primary liability coverage for any liability assumed under an \"insured contract\" under the terms of the automobile liability policy. The complaint alleges that at the time of the accident Stewart was driving his 2007 Chevy Colorado eastbound on Samaritan Avenue when he turned onto College Boulevard and hit Lopeman.  The complaint further alleges that Stewart was responsible for excess liability for the December 2, 2015 accident.  In its judgment, the court found that the liability of Stewart was excess over any other collectible insurance, and that the city was liable as to the extent of Stewart's liability.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Stewart consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Market Abuse Unit in the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Enforcement's Asset Management Unit. The matter was supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Secretary of State's Office, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Ohio Attorney General's Office."
