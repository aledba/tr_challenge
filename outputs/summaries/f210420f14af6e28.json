  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in a civil injunctive action brought by a private company seeking to halt construction of a natural gas pipeline.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the District of Columbia, alleges that FERC violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the Commission's issuance of a Certificate of Approval (CAA) in violation of Section 7 of the Exchange Act. The complaint also alleges that, as a result of the issuance of the CAA, FERC has the exclusive jurisdiction to review any pipeline certificate issued by the agency, even if the agency is not required to do so by law.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants were not entitled to meaningful judicial review when they sought to challenge an agency order issued by FERC, because they were not subject to the jurisdiction of the court of appeals.  According to the complaint, the Commission issued a CAA without requiring the defendants to show cause and effect why they would not be able to challenge the Commission order.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $10,000. The court also granted the defendants the right to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest in the future.  On May 24, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Northern District of California granted the SEC and FERC's request for a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendants' assets, and appointing a receiver to oversee the project. The SEC and the receiver have agreed to settle the case by consenting to the issuance and filing of a court order. The receiver has agreed to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount that the receiver will pay in the district court.  A hearing for the receiver has been scheduled for May 26, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-1005 (January 17, 2018).  The Commission has also agreed to a preliminary injunction, which requires the receiver to provide a copy of the final judgment to the receiver. The Commission's order also requires that all relief be sought by the receiver in the appropriate court of the district.  This settlement is subject to court approval.  Among other things, the SEC has not agreed to the appointment of a receiver."
