  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against Christopher Sindone, a third habitual offender, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Detroit, Michigan, alleges that, in 2016, Sindone set fire to a trailer belonging to his estranged wife, Jennifer Sindone. The complaint alleges that the trailer was dilapidated and uninhabitable, and that defendant intentionally lit the trailer on fire to create the appearance of a \"dwelling\" fire. According to the complaint, the trailer did not qualify as a dwelling because it was not used for purposes of second-degree arson and preparation to burn a dwelling. Instead, the complaint alleges, the defendant intentionally set the fire because he was \"placed in danger of physical injury or loss of life\" because of the fire. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of 12 to 40 years and a $10,000 civil penalty. The judgment also orders Sindone to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,038,767, which will be deemed satisfied by the court at a later date. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Sindone arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint. The SEC previously charged Sindone for his role in a similar conduct.  On December 24, 2016, the jury found Sindone liable for second- and third-degree felony arson for the purpose of scoring OV 4. The court also found that Sindone had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the trailer and that she did not have standing to challenge the search and seizure of items from the trailer. The Court also ordered Sindone and the children to be restrained from using the internet to disseminate information about the alleged conduct of the other defendants.  For further information, see People v. Zahn, 444 Mich. App. 514, 519; 826 N.W.2d 536 (2008).  The court's order also prohibits the destruction or destruction of any evidence, including any evidence of a person who was injured or harmed by the conduct of a criminal defendant. The order also requires the court to determine whether a defendant is a \"victim\" within the meaning of"
