  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against three defendants in a class action action brought by Nijjar Realty, Inc.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that, on May 6, 2012, a federal judge in Los Angeles issued an order vacating an arbitration award.  According to the complaint, the court found that the arbitration award did not apply to the parties' class and representative claims, and that the court had no jurisdiction to determine whether the parties could arbitrate those claims.  In a parallel action, filed on April 9, 2013, the SEC charged the defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,000. The court also granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from participating in any class or representative arbitration proceeding, and granted them the right to apply for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 1294 of the Exchange Act and Rule 1294-1 thereunder, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $2,500 each.  On May 8, 2013 the court granted the parties an emergency court order to expedite the expedited discovery and hearing of the case, which is subject to court approval.  As part of the emergency court's order, the parties agreed to pay a $100,000 civil penalty and to the appointment of an independent arbitrator. The settlement is pending final approval by the court. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."
