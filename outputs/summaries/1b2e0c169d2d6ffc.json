  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Troy Landry, a former Abbeville Police Department officer who was convicted of soliciting the murder of his wife.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, Landry told a friend that he wanted to have his wife killed because she was his best friend.  The complaint alleges that Landry's friend, Ryan Boutte, told Landry that he would use a crossbow to kill his wife, Jennifer Hutchinson, and that the friend would \"easily take a rabbit or squirrel\" if he could get the crossbow.  Landry also allegedly told the friend that one of his friends was going to kill her.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the friend was not a threat to the victim and did not threaten her life.  Instead, the complaint alleges Landry sought to have Jennifer Hutchinson killed because he was afraid of being caught by law enforcement.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Landry.  On October 7, 2015, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered Landry to surrender his passport, and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the federal court for the southern district of New Orleans on January 24, 2018, the Court granted the request for a temporary restraining order and ordered a hearing on October 13, 2018 to determine whether to impose a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, or a penalty equal to or greater than the amount of the defendant's alleged ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and an officer-and-director bar.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the New Orleans Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter.
