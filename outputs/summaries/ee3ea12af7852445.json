  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against OSF HealthCare System, Inc., an Illinois-based health care company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago on April 27, 2016, OSF and its co-defendant, St. Anthony\u2019s Health Center, LLC, filed a motion for summary judgment on June 5, 2017, denying the defendants\u2019 motion to expedite discovery.  The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to adequately disclose to the court that the plans they were developing were not subject to reasonable safeguards.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that OSF has failed to timely respond to its requests for additional discovery, despite repeated requests to do so.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants also failed to comply with court orders requiring them to grant the defendants expedited discovery, which is a violation of the First Amendment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On June 6, 2018, the court granted the defendants a temporary restraining order and ordered OSF to provide an accounting of the amount of money owed to the victims of the alleged fraud.  OSF also agreed to pay a $1.2 million civil penalty.  To learn more about how to apply for a partial judgment, see Litigation Release No. 13-cv-01-17 (1962).  The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Missouri, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
