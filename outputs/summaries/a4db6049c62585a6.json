  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of illegal reentry, in violation of the federal Sentencing Guidelines for Immigrant Reentry.  According to the court's order, on June 20, 2018, Ediberto Aguilar-Calvo was sentenced to thirty-eight months in prison, to run consecutive to an eight-month sentence for a supervised-release violation.  The court found that, under the sentencing guidelines, a defendant should be sentenced based on a number of factors, including the risk to which he exposed a young child and two women by keeping fentanyl in his apartment and in their presence, and the harm that opioids, fentanyl, and other drugs caused to local communities where the defendant was distributing drugs.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced that it would not hesitate to impose a lengthy prison term for a defendant with a prior felony conviction for which he had been sentenced to serve five years or more, as was the case in United States v. Hunt, 521 F.3d 801, 808 (6th Cir. 2016).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Columbus, Ohio, charges the defendant with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his prison sentence.  On October 15, 2019, the court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the issuance, purchase, or sale of any security-related documents, including a copy of the court order, as well as an officer-and-director bar."
