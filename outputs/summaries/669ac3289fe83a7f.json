  "summary": "On June 8, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a final judgment against three defendants in a drug-trafficking case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that, in January 2017, a Toledo, Ohio officer used a search warrant to search a home and seize a digital video recorder (DVR). The complaint alleges that the DVR system was not properly seized under the search warrant because it was not immediately apparent to the officers that it contained digital video recordings of drug trafficking activity. The complaint further alleges that a detective who conducted the search conducted surveillance of the home and located the DV system, which he used to record conversations with a friend who was in the home at the time of the alleged crime.  According to the complaint, the detective's testimony was insufficient to establish that the camera and DVR systems were properly seized as items closely related to the offense under investigation.  In its second assignment of error, the court found that the detective violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the officer violated the search-and-rescue provision of Section 15(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, with a civil penalty to be determined by the court at a later date. The court also granted the officer's motion for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security camera, DVR, or related computer hardware and software, and a penny stock bar against him. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On June 9, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the three defendants, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-on-hire order. The SEC is continuing its investigation into the alleged drug trafficking and related issues. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Jennifer A. Pyszka and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
