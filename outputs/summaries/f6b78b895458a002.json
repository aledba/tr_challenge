  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment against a Massachusetts man charged with interference with a police officer.  According to the SEC's complaint, on December 28, 2016, Tyngsboro, Massachusetts resident Grant L. \"Grant\" Hill, who was appointed as an officer to patrol a Boston theater, attempted to obstruct an officer by refusing to surrender his firearms and ammunition. The complaint alleges that Hill refused to comply with the officers' orders to remove the gun from his possession.  The complaint further alleges that the officers followed Hill to the theater, where Hill was confronted by a member of the theater's security staff, who confronted Hill and demanded that he surrender his gun.  As alleged in the complaint, Hill refused, and the officers and security personnel entered the theater without permission.  Hill's wife and teenaged son confronted Hill about his actions, and Hill confronted the officers, telling them that he was \"[w]overned by the will without yielding to reason; obstinate; stubborn; inflexible; and aggressive.\"  The court ultimately found that Hill violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Hill to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, Hill consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $2,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000 each.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against Hill. The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments in an investment in a real estate development project.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Boston Police Department, the Massachusetts Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Massachusetts Office of the Chief of the Market and Market Abuse Unit."
