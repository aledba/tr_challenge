  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of South Carolina today entered a final judgment in favor of the estate of Marion Kay, who died on May 3, 2007.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Greenville, South Carolina, Sullivan sought to settle the estate by claiming excessive compensation for his services in administering Kay's estate.  The complaint alleges that Sullivan sought a court-ordered partition order to prevent him from misusing the estate's funds for his personal purposes.  Sullivan allegedly sought to sell the estate at a fair market price, but the probate court found he had overcharged his fees by not paying himself as PR and instead charging Brown and Moses attorney's fees.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for South Carolina announced criminal charges against Sullivan, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay $51,300 in commissions, $13,447.05 in fees, and $42,775.00 in fees and costs.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Sullivan consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge $93,775 with prejudgment interest, and requires him to reimburse the estate for any fees and expenses incurred at the settlement hearing.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Alabama Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, and the Alabama Attorney General's Office in this matter."
