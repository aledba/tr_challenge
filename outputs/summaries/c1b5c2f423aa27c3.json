  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered final judgments in favor of a former employee of the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) who alleges that she was retaliated against for her participation in a sexual harassment complaint.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California on February 23, 2012, Melony Light, then a seasonal Park Aide at the Department's Ocotillo Wells District office, alleged that her supervisor Leda Seals and her supervisor, Lola Dolinar, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that Seals, Dolinar and Light violated the anti-retaliation provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Light consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a civil penalty of $12,765, and bars her from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court also issued a temporary restraining order, freezing Light's assets, and ordering her to return to her duties as an office assistant.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Health and Human Services, the U. S. Department of Justice, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also check the background of anyone selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint Bulletin\u00c2\u00a0on June 24, 2012.  On June 26, 2013, the SEC filed a complaint against Seals for violating the federal anti-fraud and reporting provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and against Dolinar for aiding and abetting Seals' violations of Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. "
