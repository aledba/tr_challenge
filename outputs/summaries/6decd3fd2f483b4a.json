  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment in favor of the Utah County Board of Commissioners' decision to impose a $250,000 civil penalty against Steven Downs, the Public Information Officer for Orem City, Utah.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Salt Lake City on April 19, 2016, Downs issued an email to a group of citizens who filed a petition for referendum against a city-issued bus Rapid Transit (BRT) fine. The email contained only information from the opposing side, invited recipients to attend a meeting held by opponents of the referendum, distributed a link to an anti-petition website, and did not contain any information summarizing arguments in favor or against the BRT project.  The complaint alleges that, in response, several citizens filed referendum packets and collected the necessary signatures for a referendum before submitting their petition to the city clerk. The complaint further alleges that Downs refused to supply citizens with the packets for a public meeting to discuss the matter with the entities charged with its implementation.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Utah today announced criminal charges against Downs. The SEC's Complaint against Downs alleges that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 20A-11-1205 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, and 13b2-1 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Utah Attorney General's Office has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Bryan A. Garner and supervised by Scott A. Thompson of the Salt Lake Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Garner. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Utah Office of Inspector General in this matter."
