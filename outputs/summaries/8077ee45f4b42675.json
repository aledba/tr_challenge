  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against a California mother for her role in a failed family reunification effort.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Francisco, California on May 14, 2015, Maria Rodriguez-Rodrigues, a California resident, was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting Rodriguez's and Rodrigues' violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  The complaint alleges that Rodriguez and Rodriguez violated Section 5 by failing to provide timely and reasonable assistance to the children.  In addition, the complaint alleges Rodriguez violated the anti-fraud provision of Section 355(b)(10) and Rule 355(a) and (c) thereunder.  Rodriguez also was charged for failing to comply with a court order requiring her to submit to random drug tests for her children and failing to follow up on opportunities for her to receive tutoring.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Rodriguez has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requires her to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years. Rodriguez has also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  On September 16, Rodriguez pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Rodriguez, who pleaded guilty in a parallel criminal case, has agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States. Rodriguez agreed to the settlement without admitting, denying, or denying Rodriguez's motion for a preliminary injunction, and to a permanent injunction against Rodriguez. Rodriguez also agreed not to participate in the offering of any additional services under Section 5. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Scott Frost and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the San Francisco Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Rodriguez and Mr. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Carolyn R. Braunstein. The examination that led to Rodriguez's conviction was conducted by David A. Kasper of the Los Angeles Regional Office, and the case was supervised by Cheryl P. Barry of the Office of Advocacy and Advocacy."
