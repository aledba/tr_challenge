  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Lisa K. Pazour, a California resident who was denied Social Security disability benefits in 2012.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York on May 7, 2013, Pazou was diagnosed with severe back pain and had lower back surgery in 2002 and 2004.  The complaint alleges that, while she was receiving treatment for her back pain, she was unable to do any physical activity, including walking, standing, or standing, and that she frequently complained of numbness and numbness in her feet.  In addition, the complaint alleged that she had developed a severe back condition in which she could only handle short car rides due to pain.  As alleged in the complaint, however, this was not consistent with the evidence in the record, and the complaint was not supported by the evidence presented to the court.  For example, as alleged, in a September 2012 letter to a state agency reviewing physician, Dr. James R. Lamorgese, who reviewed the medical record and reviewed it, that he had not conducted a recent physical examination of Pazzour and had not observed her progress.  Instead, he relied primarily on his credibility assessment of her, which was flawed.  He also failed to consider the fact that the state agency reviewed her medical records and found no evidence or evidence to support her claims.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the SEC, the SEC consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendant to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws.  On May 9, 2014, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction against further injunctive relief, ordered the appointment of a receiver, and ordered the receiver to conduct an examination of the injured person's spine. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry and Mr. Birkenheier. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California and the Federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission."
