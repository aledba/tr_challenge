  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Demar Carter, a 19-year-old New Orleans man who was charged with simple battery in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered an order suspending Carter from appearing or practicing before the Commission on Juvenile Justice.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Orleans, Carter was approached by D.S., who questioned him about an incident that had occurred on March 11, 2016, the night before. The complaint alleges that the defendant ignored the officer's questions and continued to walk, at which point he was struck in the head with a closed fist to the back of his head, causing him to fall to the ground.  Carter's sister, Tatiyana Williams, testified that she saw the alleged attack and that she was concerned that the officer had fed the victim his name, creating a risk for misidentification.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Carter.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Carter consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The Commission's Office of Advocacy and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Advisers.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.N. Office of Child and Family Education, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Louisiana Department of Health and Human Services."
