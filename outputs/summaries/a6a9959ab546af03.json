  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Su Su, a Taiwanese citizen who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that Su signed a guaranty agreement with a group of lenders in 2010 that guaranteed a $91 million loan to E Whale Corporation.  According to the complaint, Su signed the guaranty in Taiwan, and in 2013, E Whale Corp. and other companies in Su's family filed bankruptcy petitions in the United States and elsewhere.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Su was not subject to general jurisdiction in Texas because he was not a party to the bankruptcy proceedings.  In addition, the complaint alleges that he did not participate in the issuance or purchase of the loan and that he signed a false statement to the court stating that the loan was guaranteed by Su.  Su also allegedly did not have a valid claim against Mega International Commercial Bank Co., Ltd., a South African bank, and that Mega International was not required to make formal payments for the services provided by the various management companies not owned by Su in the case.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Su consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, with the amount of any civil monetary relief to be determined by the court at a later date.  On August 15, 2019, the Honorable Judge James E. Currid granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar, ordering Su to pay a civil penalty of $160,000, and ordering him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Currid also agreed to be enjoined from associating with any third party or a third party in connection with the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the public company.  He also agreed not to be associated with any entity that had received personal guarantees from Su backing the loan from E Whale, and to be prohibited from participating in any offering of securities in any public company that does not already have personal jurisdiction over a company that has a substantial amount of debt.  Finally, Currid agreed to the appointment of a receiver to determine whether the receiver had a duty to collect on the debt owed to the company under the terms of the trustee"
