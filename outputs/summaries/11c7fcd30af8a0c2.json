  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former Chicago Police Department fingerprint expert for his role in a residential burglary.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, from September 2015 to September 2016, Tom Slowinski entered his apartment and left a partial fingerprint on a piece of a headphone case.  According to the complaint, Slowinski's apartment was ransacked and torn apart, and he left a single, incomplete fingerprint on the headphone case inside the apartment.  As alleged, the fingerprint expert had been trained in fingerprint analysis and had been qualified as an expert in the area of fingerprint identification and identification on five occasions.   The complaint alleges that Dennewitz attempted to verify his findings with an independent fingerprint analyst, but was unable to do so because he had been out of town the week before the burglary and had given a house key to a friend.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a conduct-based injunction.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Slowinski. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check whether they are registered professionals and whether they have any background in the field of fingerprint analysis.  For example, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
