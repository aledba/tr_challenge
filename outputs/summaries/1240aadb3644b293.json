  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against a Florida-based attorney who has agreed to settle a workers' compensation case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that the Florida Department of Health and Human Services (DOAH) issued a false and misleading opinion in favor of the employer-employer-director relationship (\u201cDOAH\u201d) between two physicians and an independent medical examiner.  According to the complaint, the OAH agreed to a rule that requires the DOAH to determine whether an injured employee has the right to receive compensation based on clear and convincing medical evidence.  In a parallel action, the Florida Attorney General's Office today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action against the DoAH for violating the federal securities laws.  To settle the SEC's action, DOAH has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 440.13(9)(c) of the Florida Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 440.14(4)-(a) thereunder, and ordering it to provide for an independent examination of the injured employee's medical condition.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, DoAH has also agreed to an order that permanently enjoins it from acting as an unregistered broker-dealer with the employer and from participating in the issuance of any compensation order.  DoAH and DoAH have agreed to be enjoined from violating these provisions.  Additionally, Doah has agreed not to violate the prerogative to impose rules governing evidence and to assist in the resolution of a dispute arising under this provision.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Aug. 2, 2018).  The Commission on Compensation and Examinations has issued an Order appointing an independent expert to evaluate the merits of a claim against DoAH. The Commission has also issued an order requiring DoAH to provide an independent, unbiased examination of injured workers.  This order, which is subject to court approval, has also been issued by the Florida Secretary of State's Office and the Florida Division of Administrative Hearings (DALSA).  In its order appointing the independent expert, the Commission also issued a subpoena for DoAH staff to assist with the investigation of DoAH's claims against Doah. The order also requires Doah to provide a copy of the Doah's letter to each of the parties involved in the matter. Doah will comply with the Commission's order by signing the subpoena."
