  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment in favor of granting the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and other emergency relief.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that two companies, Southern Peru Copper Corp. and Occidental Petroleum Corp., violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that the companies violated the anti-fraud provision of the Exchange Act, and that they violated the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Exchange Act Rules 5(b)(5) and 5(d) thereunder, and the broker-dealer registration provision of Section 15(a)(1) of Rule 15a-3 thereunder of the federal securities laws. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the District Of Columbia today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  According to the complaint, the SEC obtained a court order temporarily restraining the defendants from violating the federal laws, including Section 15a of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 1940, and Rule 15b2-1. The court also issued an order freezing the defendants' assets and ordering them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 each.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Defendants have consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the above-mentioned provisions, and from participating in any future conduct-based injunctive action. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Graham. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, the United States Secret Service, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
