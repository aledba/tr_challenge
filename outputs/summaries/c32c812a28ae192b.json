  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island today entered a final judgment against the Rhode Island Department of Health in favor of the physicians' motion to dismiss their administrative appeals.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Providence, Rhode Island, alleges that, on July 2, 2013, the first hearing justice of the Commission for Human Rights issued a finding of unprofessional conduct against the physicians in connection with the department's failure to adequately comply with several of their discovery requests.  According to the complaint, the hearing officer ultimately issued a judgment that permanently enjoins the department from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 42-35-15 of the Administrative Procedures Act of 1940 and orders the department to submit a certified administrative record by August 3, 2016.  In its order, the court also ordered that the department return the original administrative record, which had been submitted to the Commission by the time the complaint was filed.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's order, however, the physicians have consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties of up to $100,000.  On May 21, 2014, a hearing was held on the request of the court for a hearing on the merits of the physician's motion for a temporary restraining order, which the court granted on May 9, 2014.  As part of the settlement, the Commission agreed to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, and to the appointment of a second hearing justice to determine whether to proceed with the administrative proceeding.  To learn more about administrative proceedings, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (R.I. 2010).  The Commission's complaint charges the Department of Labor and Training with violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 5b-5 and 5c-8 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction against further violations of Section 5(b)(5).  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of New York today announced criminal charges against the three physicians, charging them with violating Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 5b2-1 thereunder. The complaint also charges the department with violating Rule 5a-3 thereunder and with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0The Commission's Rules of Practice and Rules 206(3) and 206 (4) under Section 10(b) of"
