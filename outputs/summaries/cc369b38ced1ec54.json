  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Minnesota today announced criminal charges against a St. Joseph, Minn. man accused of driving while impaired.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Minnesota, alleges that, in March 2016, officers stopped a motor vehicle driven by Brett Michael Wood after he refused to submit to a blood test. The complaint alleges that Wood refused to consent to the taking of a sample of his blood after he was arrested for DWI. According to the complaint, the officers did not read the implied-consent advisory and, instead, sought and obtained a search warrant for Wood\u2019s blood. Wood allegedly refused to comply with the search warrant, and the officers executed the warrant without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The SEC alleges that the officers violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. In a parallel action, the Minnesota Attorney General's Office today announced that it has filed an emergency action against Wood, charging him with violating the federal securities laws. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of the securities laws, including the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 16(a)(1) and the registration provision of Section 206(8). The court also issued an order suspending Wood from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, including securities in exchange for a share of a penny, and ordering Wood to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  In a related administrative proceeding, the SEC charged Wood with a related felony, and charged him with driving while under the influence of a controlled substance. Wood has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus interest, with a penalty to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Kathleen M. Welshhans of the Minnesota Court of Appeals issued an Order suspending Wood, ordering him to surrender his passport, and appointing a receiver to conduct a field sobriety test."
