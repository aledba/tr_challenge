  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Diogenes De Jesus Sierra on two counts of a Superseding Indictment for his role in a drug-related scheme.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Sierra and his brothers, David and Robert Sierra, who are charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, on April 14, 2010, Sierra entered and exited of a building at 2771 Bainbridge Avenue in the Bronx with a small blue gift bag, which he claimed belonged to him. The court found that, shortly after Sierra entered the building, another co-conspirator, Robert Santos, was observed exiting the building carrying a similar bag. The Court also found that Sierra had failed to show sufficient evidence to support a finding of probable cause for Sierra's arrest.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Sierra. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, charges Sierra with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Sierra has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and imposing an officer-and-director bar.  Sierra has also agreed to a five-year bar from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  On March 13, 2014, the court granted Sierra's motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered him to surrender his passport, and issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receiver.  At trial, Sierra pleaded guilty to one count of possession of a controlled substance, and was sentenced to indeterminate imprisonment of 28 months to 7 years.  After a four-day trial in July of 2012, Sierra was arrested and charged with three counts of possession with the intent to distribute and sell heroin.  As alleged in the complaint, Sierra had been previously convicted of three controlled substance charges and sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison.  Last week, the Court granted Sierra a temporary injunction and ordered a hearing in which he would be sentenced to 10 years of supervised release.   The Court's order also prohibits Sierra from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security"
