  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was found guilty of two counts of felony battery in connection with the beating death of Paul Guerrant.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that Aaron Howell was the only defendant to be convicted of a felony battery charge.  According to the complaint, Appellant told a friend that he had killed Guerrant because he was \"playing with [his] sh*t\" after he was hit by a car the night of the murder.  He also allegedly claimed that at a homeless shelter in Florida about two years before Guerrant was killed, that he \"threw everything\" after the murder, and that he threw everything at the victim.  In addition, the complaint alleges that during a pretrial hearing on January 8, 2015, Appelant confessed to Williams and told the friend he had recently beaten and killed a white man who had been \"talking smack\" to him in a wooded area near Dozier Street.  Williams agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint and consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On February 13, 2019, the U. S. District Judge in Atlanta granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the SEC to conduct an examination of the evidence that led to the discovery of the alleged battery.  A hearing on February 14, 2019 was conducted in the Atlanta Regional Office, and the case was supervised by Assistant Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations.  An SEC examination that followed the examination was conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Atlanta Police Department, the Georgia State Department of Justice, the FBI, the United States Secret Service, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the Alabama State Police, the Chattanooga Police Department Criminal Investigations Division and the Georgia Department of Banking and Securities and Investments Division."
