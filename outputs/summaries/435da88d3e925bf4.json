  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Lewis Ervin, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 262 months of imprisonment and a five-year supervised release for crack cocaine-related offenses.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Ervin was convicted under a federal sentencing regime for possession with intent to distribute (commonly known as \"crack\") of crack cocaine in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that Ervin violated the mandatory minimum, five years, at five grams of crack and five hundred grams of powder cocaine, and was subsequently sentenced to a total of 262 months and a four-year sentence.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Ervin.   The SEC's Complaint alleges that, based on Ervin's past criminal history, he was eligible for a reduction in his sentence under Section 404 of the federal securities laws.  Ervin agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, and agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  He also agreed to pay a $1,500 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On May 24, 2019, the Honorable Judge Fischer granted the SEC a temporary restraining order and ordered Ervin to comply with the court's order.  As part of the settlement, the court will determine whether to impose a permanent injunction, impose a conduct-based penalty, and issue a judgment that imposes a penalty equal to the amount of the penalty.  Additionally, the Court will consider the merits of the relief sought by the SEC in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release Order No. 5, 2019. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice Criminal Division, and the Federal Office of Inspector General."
