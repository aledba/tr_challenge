According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, Salvador T. Jimenez was diagnosed with and began receiving treatment for depression in June 2009. The complaint alleges that Jimenez's medical condition deteriorated significantly during his treatment, and he was unable to participate in work related activities. In a second case, the SEC charged Jimenez with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the Commission agreed to a permanent injunction prohibiting Jimenez from participating in or participating in any kind of substantial gainful work. The Commission also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which Jimenez consented to.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael E. Hegarty and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0report\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0successor.\u00c2\u00a0of\u00c2\u00a0individuals and\u00c2\u00a0institutions\u00c2\u00a0that invest in\u00c2\u00a0people with\u00c2\u00a0specialized\u00c2\u00a0interest\u00c2\u00a0in\u00c2\u00a0disciplinarity.\u00c2\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0regardless of whether they are self-described professionals or not,\u00c2\u00a0it is important for investors to be aware of the risks of investment decisions made in this matter.
