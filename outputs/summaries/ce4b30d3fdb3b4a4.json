The court found that the two attorneys violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the court's order, the attorneys violated Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 5b-5 thereunder, and the books and records and records provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Exchange Act.
