  "summary": "On January 24, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of the company's motion for a temporary restraining order (NTCP) against Gary Parsons.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges that, on March 27, 2015, while working for Employer, Claimant sustained a low back strain while performing a work-related physical disability. According to the complaint, the injury occurred on the morning of Friday, March 27 and, on the date of the injury, the employer issued a notice of temporary compensation payable, which stated that the first day of the 90-day period for temporary compensation benefits was the date that Claimant received his full pay for the day. The complaint further alleges that the employer paid Claimant his full wages for the period from March 27 through June 29, 2015. The SEC alleges that Employer failed to timely approve the NTCP, which requires employers to pay for workers' compensation benefits after 90 days of payment. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the company consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a penalty amount equal to the amount of compensation paid to the claimant. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced criminal charges against Claimant.  On July 13, 2017, the Court issued an order requiring the company to comply with the Commission's order by issuing a Notice of Temporary Restraining Order (TTCP).  In its order, the Commission also ordered the employer to provide a copy of the TTCP's order, which was later denied by the Commission. The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson."
