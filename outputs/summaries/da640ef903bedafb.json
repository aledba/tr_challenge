  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a family court finding that mother violated the court's order to temporarily suspend her contact with her son.  The court found that, contrary to the court order, mother had repeatedly violated the parent-child contact order by failing to comply with the new contact schedule and by making repeated attempts to obstruct father's and mother's attempts to obtain custody of the children. The court also found that mother had continued to threaten and encourage N.W. to disregard the previous contact schedule, and that she had engaged in other ways to undermine the relationship between father and mother.  In its final judgment, the court ruled that mother was in the best interests of her children and that the court should consider suspending her access to the child's records.  Without admitting or denying the findings of the court, mother consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently suspended her from contact with the children, permanently enjoining her from violating the prior order, and ordering her to pay child support and maintenance, and prohibiting her from contacting the children as required by the court. The final judgment permanently enjoins mother from violating these provisions and orders, and orders her to return the children to her father. The order also prohibits her from engaging in contact with school personnel or medical personnel unless she demonstrates that she understands the impact her behavior had on the children's well-being.  On November 10, 2016, the family court granted mother's request for a temporary restraining order against further violations of the prior court order. The family court also denied mother's motion for a hearing on November 24, 2016.  According to the SEC's order, filed in federal district court in New York, mother violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the court granted her a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Marc Blau of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau and Ms. Mascianica. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District, the British Columbia Securities Commission, the United States Postal Inspection Service and the Federal Office of Inspector General."
