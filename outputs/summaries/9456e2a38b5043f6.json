  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Jason Alexander Broadway, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 262 months of imprisonment for possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of crack cocaine.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, on August 3, 2010, Mr. Broadway, who is currently serving a term of imprisonment in federal custody, told the court that he was responsible for 487.82 grams of illegal crack cocaine, which was the amount of the drug that triggered mandatory minimums for the drug.  The complaint further alleges that, while he agreed to the mandatory minimum sentence, he was not entitled to a reduction in his sentence because he was already serving a sentence for a previous drug-related conviction.  In a parallel action, on December 21, 2018, the United States District Court in New Jersey entered a judgment against Broadway, ordering him to pay a penalty of 262 months.  On January 24, 2019, the court entered a default judgment against him, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Court also issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and imposing a $1,000 civil penalty against the defendants.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Department of Corrections, and the New York State Department of Justice in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Manhattan on Jan. 17, 2020, charging Broadway with violating Section 5 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against him.  To learn more about supervised release, see Investor Alert:"
