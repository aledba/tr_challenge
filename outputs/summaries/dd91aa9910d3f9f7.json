  "summary": "On July 21, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee entered a final judgment against Memphis resident William Thomas Jr. for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Memphis, Tennessee, alleges that, in 2006, Thomas submitted an application for a state advertising permit and a local building permit. The SEC found that Thomas could not have a valid permit if his site was unbuildable under local zoning laws, and that Thomas was not acting in good faith when he began construction on the billboard. According to the complaint, Thomas received conflicting information from local officials about the status of the permit and determined that the site was zoned as floodway rather than floodway, despite the determination made by fellow local government employees at OPD. Thomas continued to dispute the zoning with OPD officials over the following months. Finally, on August 12, 2016, the court denied Thomas\u2019s request for a summary judgment and denied his motion for a preliminary injunction.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for Middle Tennessee today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Thomas, charging him with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933, and with aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b-3 thereunder, and against Thomas for violating Section 15(a) the Exchange Act and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder and for violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Thomas has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078, and prejudgment interest of $2,038, and orders Thomas to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Thomas has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  On August 28, 2015, Thomas filed a motion for summary judgment against OPD, finding that OPD violated Section 15a-3 and ordering Thomas to comply with the court order. Thomas also has agreed to pay an $80,000 civil penalty and to be restrained from appearing before the SEC as an attorney"
