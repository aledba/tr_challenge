  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas on February 27, 2017 entered a final judgment in favor of Chrimar Systems, Inc., a Texas-based company that claims to control and manage remote electronic equipment on a wired network.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Houston, Chrimars raised the issue of alleged violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that, contrary to the defendants\u2019 representations to the court that the patents were essential to the provision of the wireless internet standard, and that the defendants failed to adequately appreciate the value of nonpatented and patented features and standardization in the patents.  In addition, according to the complaint, the defendants made numerous misrepresentations and omissions to the jury in order to induce them to take action against them.  For example, the SEC alleges that one of the defendants, Robert Mills, made a misrepresentation in a supplemental report to a jury that relied on the testimony of a technical expert who reviewed the material in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations, and orders him to pay $324,558.34 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $32,500.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Department of Insurance, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
