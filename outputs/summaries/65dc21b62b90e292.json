  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Florida today entered a final judgment in favor of the franchisor of World of Beer restaurants, which sell beer, tavern fare, and other authorized products in a pub environment.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida on September 21, 2017, WOBF and its principal, Evan Matz, entered into a franchise agreement in which they agreed to a settlement that included the issuance of a preliminary injunction and the imposition of a civil injunctive relief order. The settlement, which was subject to court approval, requires the parties to submit disputes to arbitration and mediation within 60 days following the appointment of a mediator. Matz has agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, and to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the franchise agreements and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The judgment also prohibits Matz from participating in any offering of a penny stock or offering of any penny stock, and prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Burt of the Miami Regional Office and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Division of Securities and Exchange Commission in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Matz.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that Matz violated the antifraud provisions of Section 23(a) of the Franchise Agreement and Rules 23(b) and 23(c) thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, in violation of those provisions, Matz failed to timely and contemporaneously submit his dispute to arbitration.   The complaint charges Matz with violating Section 23 (a) and (c) and, therefore, seeks preliminary injunctions, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar.  Matz consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains and pay prejudgment"
