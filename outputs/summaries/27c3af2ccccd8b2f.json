  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against defendant David Kimble, who was charged with four counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse based on a jury deadlock.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that Kimble violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Securities Act Section 13(b)(2)(A) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  In its judgment, the court held that the defendants violated the double jeopardy provision of the federal securities laws, and that the jury was at an impasse.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Kimble consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, which includes disgorgement of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a $25,000 civil penalty. The court also ordered Kimble to comply with the SEC order requiring him to be barred from appearing before the SEC as a witness in a case involving a defendant who had been convicted of a prior felony. The final judgment also prohibits Kimble from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of a judgment that imposes a permanent injunction, prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and requires him to provide an accounting of the amount of money spent on the alleged misconduct. The Court also granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order against Kimble and ordered him to return to the United States. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Police Department, and the Illinois State Attorney General's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221."
