  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against Eagle Enclave Development, Inc., a private boat club located in Evansville, Indiana.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, alleges that Eagle violated the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b)(5) of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, Eagle agreed to settle the SEC's charges by raising a second counterclaim, which alleged that IDEM had failed to timely respond to Eagle's request to remove sediment from an off-site pond owned by Barbara Bolin.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that, as a result of Eagle's violations, IDEM was unable to determine the amount of sediment in the pond that was attributable to its actions, and that it was an abuse of agency discretion for IDEM to deny Eagle's third counterclaim.   The complaint also alleges that the trial court erred when it denied Eagle's motion for summary judgment because Eagle had raised the same issue before the OEA and had received an adverse judgment but did not timely seek judicial review of that judgment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, Eagle consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  It also orders Eagle to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  On June 1, 2016, the court granted Eagle a temporary restraining order and ordered it to submit a plan that included the specific actions Eagle would take to remove any sediment attributable to the activities at the site, including dredging the pond, and to donate property to IDEM in order to act as a buffer to control runoff from Eagle's development. The court also ordered Eagle to comply with an order appointing an independent receiver to oversee the site and to provide an accounting of any sediment that may have been discharged from the pond.  Eagle also agreed to pay an $8,500 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer and director of a public water treatment plant for five years.  As part of the settlement, Eagle has agreed to a $10,000 officer- and director bar and to a five-year bar from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson."
