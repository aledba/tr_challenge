  "summary": "On July 14, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Minnesota entered a final judgment against a Roseville, Minnesota-based nursing home trustee for the next of kin of Rosemary Schultz, who died in a car accident.  The court found that a wrongful death claim is derivative, and that the decedent is entitled to arbitration.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in Minnesota, on July 19, 2007, Jeanne Kassim admitted her mother to Lake Ridge, Minnesota, a skilled nursing facility. The court held that a right to a jury trial is not a precondition to the entry of a judgment, but rather a pre-judgment judgment that prohibits the arbitration of wrongful death claims.  As alleged in the complaint, Ms. Schultz was not insured and argued that she was asserting an independent claim as her daughter's survivor.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Kassim consented to a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Kassim. The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check whether they are registered professionals with the SEC by using the investor.gov website to find out more about how to apply for a broker-dealer discount. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Minnesota Department of Insurance, and the Minnesota Office of Insurance Regulation in this matter."
