  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a default judgment against Joseph Eustice, a California man accused of defrauding his wife in a marital dissolution proceeding.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, Joseph, a resident of Rancho Mirage, California, filed a complaint on June 18, 2012, alleging that Joseph violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that Joseph failed to provide sufficient notice of the relief requested in the complaint and failed to timely provide a copy of the final judgment.  Joseph also alleges that Annette violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act by failing to comply with court orders to produce material documents.  In a parallel action, on October 26, 2009, the same court issued a judgment that permanently enjoins Joseph from violating Section 5, and orders him to pay $275,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Annette also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay spousal and child support, $500 for her adult son's college expenses, and $100,000 for her son's high school tuition.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the filing of the complaint, Joseph consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating these provisions, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay a civil penalty, and pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  On October 27, 2009 Annette filed and served on Joseph a response to a motion for dissolution of marriage, which was filed on the same day as Joseph's response to the default judgment, without specifying the amount of relief sought in the response, and without providing an accounting of any monies withdrawn from the account since their separation.  As a result of the court's order, Joseph was not required to serve a final judgment on the merits of the matter.  Instead, he served on Annette's response, without providing any explanation for why he did not comply with the court order, and with Annette failing to provide a written response.  Finally, Annette failed to respond to Joseph's entry of the judgment, despite repeated requests to do so.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David Janssen of the Los Angeles Regional Office, with assistance from John Rymas of the Office of Investor Education and Advocacy and the Division of Enforcement's Retail Strategy Task Force. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Schwartz."
