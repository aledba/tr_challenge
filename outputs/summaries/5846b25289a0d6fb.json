  "summary": "The Illinois Department of Insurance today announced that it has obtained a final judgment against a former fireman who was found permanently disabled and unable to perform the duties of a fire department.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Chicago, Steven Covello, who was a member of the Forest Park Fire Department's fire department, suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) triggered by a specific duty-related incident.  The complaint alleges that Covello was not required to demonstrate a causal connection between his disability and the call involving Officer Russo, and that he did not seek treatment for his condition before the pension board's decision to award Covello a duty disability pension.  Covello also allegedly told a fellow firefighter that he sought treatment after the officer Russo call because he was unable to complete a particular work shift or perform certain work duties.  In fact, according to the complaint, Covello had been on duty for more than four years when Officer Russo's death occurred, and Covello sought to obtain a line-of-duty disability pension based on his preexisting physical and psychological conditions, which included anxiety and depression.  He also told the fellow firefighters that he had a history of anxiety, depression, and physical problems dating back to at least 2007, and he actively sought treatment for those conditions before the retirement of his firefighter-related disability.  On May 19, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Covello from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Covello to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission's order, the Pension Board consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antiligence provisions of the federal securities laws, and from imposing a penny stock bar on Covello. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois State Auditor's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
