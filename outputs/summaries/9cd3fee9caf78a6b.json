  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against Riverside County Sheriff's Deputies Christopher Cazarez, Mark Janecka and David Dietrich, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, alleges that, in August 2008, a licensed and armed security guard at Valle Vista Assembly of God Church in Hemet, Calif., saw Rosenthal, clad only in boxer shorts, running in place in sprinklers at the church and saying he was on fire and attempting to cool off in the water.  According to the complaint, the deputies did not use excessive force, but instead engaged in a series of split second decisions as to whether and how to detain Rosenthal and to whom he should be taken into custody.  Finally, the complaint alleges that one of the deputies, Werner Spitz, M.D., told the jury that Rosenthal was not under the influence of cocaine because only metabolites of cocaine, which cause no physiological effects, were detected in Rosenthal's blood.  Spitz also testified that Rosenthal had not used cocaine at the time of the incident, and that he had not attempted to get out of the car and attempted to drive away from the scene.  In addition, Spitz and Spitz agreed to settle the SEC's charges by agreeing to pay $66,453.02 in disgorgement, $40,610.68 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $160,000.  Green also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  On May 2, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Western District of New York granted Green's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, entered a default judgment against her, and issued a temporary restraining order against her from further violations.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Green consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations, including, without limitation, from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of any law enforcement agency, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).  The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing is scheduled for June 20, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5"
