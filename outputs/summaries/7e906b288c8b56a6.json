  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a New York City Police Department officer who was charged with unlawfully using excessive force in an emergency response to a domestic violence call.  According to the court's order, on September 25, 2012, Officer Edwin Mateo of the 26th Precinct of the New York Police Department shot and killed Mohamed Bah, an emotionally disturbed person who, at the time of the incident, was alone behind a locked door in an apartment building.  Mateo allegedly had a large kitchen knife in his hand when he fired the first shot at Bah.  The court also found that Mateo was not adequately trained in the use of force and that he did not have reasonable reason to believe that he was in imminent danger of death or serious physical injury.  In a parallel action, on Jan. 31, 2017, the United States District Court in Manhattan entered a judgment against Mateo, finding him liable on all of the charged charges against him, and ordering him to pay $2.215 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $2,215,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Mateo consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Mateo to pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $3,215.  Licitra also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  On January 31, 2018, the court granted a motion for summary judgment in favor of Mateo and the city on the emergency response and related charges against Kress, Green and Zaberto on the same day that it granted a temporary restraining order and ordered a preliminary injunction against the defendants from further violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws.  It also denied Mateo's motion for a new trial on the basis of insufficient evidence to determine whether he was entitled to qualified immunity.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Kasper and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Los Angeles Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter.  For further information, see\u00c2\u00a0Investigation Release Release Release No. 1760063 (January 24, 2018)."
