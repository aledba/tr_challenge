  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Perrino Construction, Inc. (\"Perrino\") and Greenwalt Architects, Inc., an Ohio-based construction company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on August 16, 2016, the Neels entered into a contract in which they were to construct a custom home for them for a contract price of $364,900. The contract was six pages long and included an arbitration provision that required a $2,450 filing fee for their $300,000\u2013$500,000 claim. The complaint alleges that, in the contract, the parties had agreed that the home would be at least 3,000 square feet, but the home's actual footprint was several hundred feet smaller.  The complaint further alleges that Perrinos failed to explain the arbitration clause to them, and that he was pressured to sign the contract.  In a complaint filed in federal district court in Ohio on February 17, 2017, the SEC alleges that the defendants violated Rule 48 of the Construction Industry Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) by failing to impose a reasonable attorney's fee upon the parties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Paul G. Sansone and Ms. Karpel. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Department of Commerce, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
