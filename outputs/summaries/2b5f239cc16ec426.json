  "summary": "On September 13, 2018, the Pennsylvania Employees Benefit Trust Fund (PEBTF) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Pennsylvania alleging that Kevin Joseph Brown violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Brown represented to PEBTF that he was in a common law marriage and that he had been married for 8 1/212 years.  The complaint alleges that Brown misrepresented his marital status to the company's counsel and that the company paid him medical benefits in the amount of $154,837.93.  Brown's wife, Diane M. Miller, filed a civil injunctive action against Brown on February 28, 2018.  In its amended complaint, the court found that Brown breached the contract by fraudulently representing that he and Miller were in a \"common law marriage.\"  The court also found Brown liable for breach of contract for failing to provide a reasonable inference as to whether Brown knew or should have known that he signed the Affidavit.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Brown consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $157,829, and orders him disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and to pay civil penalties of $150,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5157354, March 21, 2016, at *1 (D.N.J., Sept. 24, 2018).
