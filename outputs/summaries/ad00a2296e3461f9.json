  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Hawai'i today entered a final judgment against Vicente Domut, who was sentenced to 180 days in prison for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 5b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on August 29, 2016, Domut was stopped by Hawaii County Police Officer Lawrence Becraft (\u201cOfficer Becraft\u201d) for driving without a license and No Motor Vehicle Insurance. Domut allegedly told Becraft that he had borrowed a vehicle from Mexico or Canada and that he would have to undergo two trials to prove that he was entitled to a jury trial. The complaint alleges that Domut did not produce any proof of ownership of the vehicle, and that the burden of proof shifted to the State to disprove the defense beyond a reasonable doubt.  The complaint further alleges that the district court improperly instructed Domut not to show any evidence of a \"good faith lack of knowledge\" defense when he had already waived his right to jury trial on both of those charges.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $1,500 civil penalty and a $2,500 officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Hawaii today announced criminal charges against Domut.
