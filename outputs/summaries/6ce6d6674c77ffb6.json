  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arkansas today entered a summary judgment against the Bank of the Ozarks for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Benton County, Arkansas, alleges that, in 2000, several property owners in Arkansas petitioned the court to form an improvement district for the purpose of making infrastructure improvements for the proposed Sugar Creek subdivision. According to the complaint, the court granted the appellants' motion for summary judgment on December 1, 2000, and entered into a pledge-and-mortgage agreement in favor of the Bank. The complaint alleges that the bank failed to collect the special tax when the bonds matured, and failed to pay the principal and accumulated interest owed on the bonds after the bonds had matured.

The defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the securities laws. The judgment also prohibits the defendants from imposing any civil monetary penalties, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, sale, or sale of any bonds. The Court granted the parties' motion to summary judgment based on the court's finding that the defendants breached their obligations to the court, and ordered them to comply with the agreed-upon terms of the agreements.
