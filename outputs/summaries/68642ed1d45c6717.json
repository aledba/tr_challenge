  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment against Penny Honer and her husband, Thomas Mitchell, in a civil injunctive action.  The court found that the Honers violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, from January 2010 through September 2011, Penny and Tom Honer purchased and operated two grocery stores, Harvest Market in Fort Bragg and Harvest Market at Mendosa's in Mendocino, California.  As alleged in the complaint, the court improperly used an appraisal of the grocery stores to determine whether the value of the stores was worth enough to warrant reopening.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Penny.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Penny has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering her to pay disgorgement of $2.98 million, prejudgment interest of $1.5 million, and a civil penalty of $6,667,040.  Penny has also agreed to pay a $1,000,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.

Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litvinuk v. Mitchell (1990) No. 13-cv-11221.  On May 24, 2012, the U. S. District Judge for the Central District of Florida entered a judgment ordering a temporary restraining order against Penny from further violations of Section 5(b).
