  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Merchant Exchange Productions, Inc., a San Francisco-based hospitality company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 351 of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles on April 5, 2016, Merchant Exchange, Inc. (\"MSGI\"), a San Diego-based hotel, imposed a 21 percent service charge on hotel room service employees. The complaint alleges that the service charge is mandatory, and that the hotel is free to pay a portion of the fee to the service staff.  The complaint further alleges that, as a matter of law, the hotel does not have the right to determine whether a service charge constitutes a gratuity.  In addition, the complaint alleges, as set forth in the complaint, that Merchant Exchange failed to adequately disclose to its employees that it was not entitled to a \"service charge\" as required by federal law.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating Section 351, and order them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits. The settlements are subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 17, and No. 207, No., No. 206. \u00c2\u00a017, No\u00c2\u00a020, No 23, no.\u00c2\u00a026, no\u00c2\u00a027, no\u00a030, no #8, no... no.   \u00c2\u00c2\u00a0No. 17 (MSGI) is entitled to permanent injunctions against violations of the above-mentioned provisions, and to the appointment of a receiver to determine the appropriate amount of compensation to be paid to the receiver.  Additionally, the court found that the defendants violated Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the receiver to disgorge his or her ill-gotten gains with interest, pay civil penalties, and pay a $1,000,000 civil penalty.  Finally, the Court found that, in violation of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act, the company violated Section 351 and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder. The court also found that defendants violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and (3) of Securities Act, and Section 5(b).  The court granted the defendants' requests for a temporary restraining order and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of Section 5"
