  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a former physical scientist at the Army's Topographic Engineering Center for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleges that, while working as a physical scientist, Tish Kennan, Alana Hubbard, and Marty Downing were among Campbell\u2019s co-workers who complained to him that he was a threat to national security and that he should not be reassigned to unclassified duties. Campbell allegedly told them that he had located information about her estranged husband on the internet and that she needed to jump-start her car. According to the complaint, Campbell also allegedly claimed that, as a result of his conduct, he could no longer follow her home from the Topographic engineering center. The complaint further alleges that Campbell was not permitted to have lunch with his coworkers because he was not qualified to handle classified work. The SEC alleges that the Army violated the anti-harassment provisions of the federal securities laws when it suspended Campbell from his position as an engineer research and development center employee. Campbell has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order suspending Campbell from serving as an officer or director of a federal agency. The agency's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Marc Blau of the Atlanta Regional Office. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Guillot. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Office of Personnel Management in this matter."
