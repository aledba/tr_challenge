  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Utah today entered a final judgment against Feuu Fagatele, a Utah resident who was convicted of third-degree aggravated assault in 2013.  The court found that, under the federal securities laws, a defendant can commit third- or even fourth- degree aggravated assault by using \"other means or force\" when he or she is \"likely to produce death or serious bodily injury.\"  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Salt Lake City, Utah, on November 5, 2019, Fagateel raised the issue of whether a defendant could be convicted of a felony by using a \"force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person\" when, in reality, a person who uses a dangerous weapon or \"threat of violence\" would be liable for a felony conviction.  In its judgment, the court held that, in a reasonable state of affairs, an individual can commit a felony with a reasonable use of force.  Without admitting or denying the court\u2019s findings, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 46 months and a $75,000 civil penalty.  Fagateile also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and to pay civil penalties of $25,000 and $50,000, respectively.  To settle the case, the judge agreed to a permanent injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply after five years of imprisonment. The court also granted the defendant a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from associating with any third-party law violator, and a penny stock bar against him.  On November 6, 2018, the Court granted the SEC's request for an emergency asset freeze and an officer-and-director bar, and ordered the SEC to conduct a parallel investigation. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Kelly and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Salt Lake Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Kelly. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson and Ms. Kelly, and the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Internal Revenue Service, the U."
