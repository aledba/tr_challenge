  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the City of Vallejo, California, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that the City violated the federal securities laws by failing to comply with certain provisions of the 2009 agreement, including the right to retiree medical benefits at the full Kaiser rate.  According to the complaint, as part of a settlement, the City agreed to pay $300 per month as the full premium of any health plan offered through the city.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as a result of the City\u2019s failure to meet those obligations, it was unable to provide a vested right to a defined retirement medical benefit.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the city consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the securities laws, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC also ordered the City to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and the city to pay civil penalties of $500,000 and $100,000, respectively, for violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also ordered a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar.  On May 2, the SEC filed an emergency action against the city, charging it with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of its Investment Advisers Act, and with aiding and abetting the city's violations of the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 9 of the Exchange Act. The complaint also charges the city with violating Section 15(a)(1) of Exchange Act Rule 10a-5, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations.  To settle the SEC's case, the Commission of Inspections and Examinations has issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the Commission's investigation of the Commission. The Commission has also issued a subpoena to determine whether the Commission has sufficient authority to issue an order requiring the Commission to conduct an independent examination of all contracts and to provide an accounting of the financial condition of each contract.  A hearing on June 20, 2012, was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. for the Commission on Audit and Rule 15a-1. The hearing was delayed by one day.   The Commission"
