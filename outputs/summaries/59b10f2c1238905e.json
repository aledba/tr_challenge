  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a motion to compel arbitration in a case brought by a group of Asian-American and South Asian investors.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Guilford County, North Carolina, alleges that defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, defendants failed to comply with the arbitration provisions of the federal securities laws.  In addition, the complaint alleges defendants sought to influence an arbitrator to determine whether the arbitration should be conducted by the court, rather than by the arbitrator, as alleged in the complaint.  As alleged, defendants also failed to disclose that the arbitration clause in the agreement was in violation of Section 9(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules 10b2-1, and that defendants had a fiduciary duty to engage fairly with the minority shareholders in signing the agreement.  For example, one of the defendants claimed that he had signed the agreement with a valuation firm to assess the value of ImaginAsian when, in fact, the valuation firm had not, and therefore did not have the right to arbitrate the matter.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requiring them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $50,000 or more.  On November 9, 2012, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against the defendants and ordered them to furnish a bond as a security for their derivative claims.  Two days later, a federal district court ruled that the defendants had waived their right to arbitration based upon their participation in a prior arbitration proceeding.   The court also denied the request for an injunction against further violations of the securities laws, ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and ordering the arbitrators to consider the merits of the relief sought by the parties in the litigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David I. Hurwitz, Michael Hong, Theodore Kim, and Sang Heum Cho of the Chicago Regional Office, with the assistance of the Office of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Illinois and the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. The litigation will be led by Mr. Hong and Ms. Kim."
