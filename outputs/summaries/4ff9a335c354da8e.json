  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Connecticut man for failing to comply with a court order to suspend him from practicing medicine.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Britain, Connecticut, alleges that Jose Estela, a resident of Connecticut, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he was deprived of his rights under Section 5 of the Exchange Act because he did not comply with the court order.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Estela was not dismissed as a matter of course because the court found that the defendant improperly had restricted his hospital privileges and engaged in anticompetitive behavior by stealing his patients.  According to the complaint, Estela's case was handled by Mary Alice Moore Leonhardt, a trial counsel for Abbott Laboratories, Inc., a registered representative of Abbott Laboratories.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed on August 3, 2011, the court granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, without admitting or denying the court's findings, and granted him the right to a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws. The court also denied the defendant's motion to bifurcate, which was sought by the SEC as part of a settled administrative proceeding.  On October 28, 2013, the SEC filed a complaint against Estela in which it alleged that he violated Section 5(a) and Rule 5b2-1 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that the court improperly barred him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the Judgment, and from participating as an officer or director of a public company. The SEC also charged the defendant with violating Section 10b of the Market Abuse and Rule 12b-20 thereunder and Section 17(a)(1) of Securities Act Section 10-b) and Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(A) of Exchange Act Rules 12a-20, 13a-1, and 13b-3 thereunder; and charged Estela with violating Exchange Act Rule 13d-1 and Rule 13b3-2 thereunder by failing to provide timely and accurate information to the court upon request of the SEC concerning the entry of the judgment.  To settle the case, the defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to be barred from serving as a public figure. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted"
