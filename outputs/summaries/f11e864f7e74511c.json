  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against the City of Indianapolis for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, alleges that, in August 2016, the city of Bloomington, Indiana, entered into a lease with the Gamma-Kappa Chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon (TKE) for a house that was located in an Institutional Zoning District. At the time, TKE was not sanctioned as a fraternity or sorority. The complaint further alleges that the city had improperly delegated governmental authority to Indiana University to determine whether the property was being used by fraternity members or sororities.  According to the complaint, the university's action (removing TKE from the list of sanctioned fraternities) was not an impermissible delegation of governmental authority because the property owner had failed to vacate the property, resulting in an \"illegal land use.\"  The complaint charges the city with violating the pre-clearance provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the City consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the city from violating these provisions and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $2,500. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the city.  On June 13, 2018, the court granted the BZA's request for an administrative review of the city's issuance of the NOVs. The court also issued a temporary restraining order and ordered the city to comply with the court's order. The case was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Indiana Department of Commerce, and the Indiana Office of Planning and Zoning Regulation."
