  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment in favor of an alternative liability rule that requires defendants to prove that they caused or were liable for a serious injury.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Somers, Connecticut, alleges that Christopher Jackson, Wesley Hall, and Erin Houle violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 5b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Jackson and Hall, who were teenagers at the time, entered an abandoned, privately-owned mill in Somers and litigated for summary judgment on June 2, 2012, claiming that their negligent disposal of cigarettes inside the mill resulted in a fire that destroyed both the mill and the aboveground sewage line. The complaint further alleges that the defendants' conduct was substantially simultaneous in time and of the same character so as to create the same risk of harm. In addition, the complaint alleges that, in the event that the defendant did not cause the fire, the burden of proof would be shifted to each of the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Jackson, Hall and Houle. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations, as well as an order requiring the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000. In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendants, charging them with violating Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and seeking an order to bar them from serving as officers or directors of any SEC-insured company, including the SEC, from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the SEC. The court also issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as a matter of course.  On June 9, 2013, a federal district court in New York issued a temporary restraining order, ordering the SEC to conduct a preliminary examination of the alleged causes and effect of the fire. The investigation was conducted by Scott J. Redding and Patrick R. Dragon, and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Messrs. Greiner and Redding. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry."
