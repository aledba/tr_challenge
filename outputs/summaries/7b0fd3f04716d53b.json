  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the California Department of Fire's motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Irvine, California, alleges that, since becoming a fire captain, Brett Culp made handwritten and computerized notes, referred to by the parties throughout these proceedings as daily logs, on the performance of each of the firefighters he supervised.  According to the complaint, Culp's notes were prepared by the fire department's associate superintendent, Don Cloud, and were sent to the department by the department's fire chief. The complaint alleges that Culp failed to inform the department of the adverse comments in the daily logs and failed to file a written response to each adverse comment.  Culp also allegedly failed to provide an opportunity to respond to any adverse comment in his or her personnel file.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the department has agreed to the court's order, which permanently enjoins Culp from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The court also ordered Culp to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court also issued an order freezing the assets of the department and ordering the department to provide a copy of the daily log to the fire chief, who was not present at the time of the disciplinary action. The order also prohibits the department from issuing or selling any security or other security-related documents to the public, and prohibits the destruction of documents or records.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Federal Bureau of Investigation entered a judgment against Culp, finding him liable for violations of Section 5(b) and (c) and ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains and pay a civil penalty of $2,500. The district has also agreed to pay an officer-and-director bar in the form of a penny stock and to a $100,000 asset freeze, with the amount of the civil penalty to be determined by the court at a later date. The settlement is subject to court approval. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Cal Fire District Attorney's Office and the California Office of Inspector General in this matter.
