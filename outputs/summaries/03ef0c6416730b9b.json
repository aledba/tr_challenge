  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a California-based cinematographer who was convicted of using his car in an assault with a deadly weapon.  According to the court's order, Bipialaka used drugs at a motel and then drank at a bar to frighten others. He then used his car to drive at a couple in an intersection, causing them to freak out. The court found that the threat of physical injury was serious and imminent.  The court also found that, contrary to what the court had previously held, the defendant did not have the requisite intent for a five-year felony enhancement.  In a parallel action, on December 21, 2016, a federal district court in Ohio entered a judgment that permanently enjoins defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  On January 2, 2019, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, a temporary injunction, and an officer-and-director bar. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of the United States District Judge in the Northern District of California and the case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. The litigation will be led by Lynn M. Williams and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The case has been supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and was supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov. Investors can\u00c2\u00a0check the background\u00c2\u00a0of anyone selling, offering\u00c2\u00a0an investment in\u00c2\u00a0a security deposit\u00c2\u00a0with\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  Investors can also check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0search tool to quickly spot signs of fraud and to identify suspicious activity.  For example, the SEC\u00c2\u00a0recently issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of using a car to commit a serious felony. Investors should be aware that\u00c2\u00a0one of the alleged victims is a convicted felon.   The SEC"
