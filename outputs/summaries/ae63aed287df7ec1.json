  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Oregon today announced criminal charges against a convicted pedophile accused of orchestrating a string of high-risk acts.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, alleges that, from 1999 to 2013, Timothy R. Pyszka, a registered representative of the Department of Health and Human Services (OHHS), falsely claimed that petitioner suffered from a \"mental disease or defect\" that renders him a substantial danger to others. In fact, according to the complaint, petitioner had been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder in 1999 and had been previously incarcerated for a prior felony. The complaint further alleged that, while petitioner was at risk of reoffending due to his anxiety disorder, he did not have a qualifying mental disorder. Rather, the complaint alleges that petitioner's anxiety disorder caused him to be less likely to seek out psychiatric treatment, including sex offender treatment, than he otherwise would have been. In addition, as alleged, petitioner's fear of retaliation from others resulted from his having a history of repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct, which ultimately led to his revocation of his conditional release.  In a parallel action, the federal district court for the Central District of New York today entered a final judgment against PSRB that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The court will determine the amount of restitution to be paid at a later date.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit or other security deposit in the United States. The final judgments also require PSRB to determine whether it has sufficient evidence to impose a reasonable conduct-based injunction against future violations, and that it has the authority to impose such an injunction. The SEC also has the right to request a temporary restraining order, an order appointing a receiver, or an officer and director of a public health organization, to determine the appropriate level of supervision.  Among other things, the court granted the request for an emergency court order, which requires the release of any person deemed to be a substantial risk to others, including a convicted felon, to comply with the court's order requiring him to participate in any form of psychiatric treatment. The order also requires the appointment of a receiver pursuant to the court order.  According to the SEC"
