  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Professional Transportation, Inc., a company owned and operated by Professional Transportation.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that Professional Transportation failed to obtain the required limits of uninsured (UM) and underinsured (UIM) coverage under section 8\u2013101(c) of the Illinois Vehicle Code.  According to the complaint, in October 2012, a Union Pacific employee was injured in a car accident while driving a van in which she was a passenger.  As alleged, Professional Transportation was insured by ACE American Insurance Company and used to transport Union Pacific employees between railroad jobsites pursuant to a service contract between PTI and Union Pacific.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, PTI agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $20,000, $40,000 per occurrence, and a $250,000 civil penalty.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court denied PTI's motion to dismiss, finding that it had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  The court also ruled that PTI had no right of action under Section 8-101 and that it could pursue a civil action against Carmichael for violation of that provision.  On January 30, 2015, the final judgment, entered by the court, permanently enjoining PTI from violating these provisions, ordered it to disgorge its ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, impose civil penalties, and permanently enjoin it from future violations of the securities laws, and order a hearing on the matter to determine whether to proceed with a judgment imposing civil penalties against PTI, ACE, and the other defendants. The court's order also ordered PTI to pay disgorgement of $2,829,865, plus prejudgment interests of $1,065, and to pay civil penalties of $500,000 and $1 million, respectively. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5/8-101(a) (West 2010).  The Commission on Civil and Administrative Rights has issued an Order suspending the registration of any motor vehicle, vehicle, or insurance company that does not comply with the mandatory minimum UM/UIM coverage provision of the Vehicle Code, and ordering the Commission to suspend its registration and plates. The Commission has also issued an order suspending the purchase and sale of any automobile that is not registered with the Commission."
