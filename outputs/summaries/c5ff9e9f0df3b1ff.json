  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Oregon today announced criminal charges against Seneca Sustainable Energy LLC (Seneca), an Oregon-based biomass cogeneration facility, and its appraiser in connection with a related administrative proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Eugene, Oregon, alleges that Seneca violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that the department and the appraiser violated Section 304 of the Exchange Act and Rule 304 thereunder, and that, in violation of Rule 304, Seneca failed to show that it had standing to challenge the department's determination of the real market value of Seneca's industrial property for tax years 2012-13 and 2013-14. Seneca also failed to demonstrate that its property was exempt from taxation when it entered into an agreement with the department that required it to pay a tax of $59.9 million in the year that it was in operation. The court also found that the auditor's findings were materially inconsistent with those of the tax court.  In its order, the court found that, as alleged, the auditor had no jurisdiction over Seneca, and the auditor was not as familiar with the market values of the property as Seneca claimed.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the IRS has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Seneca from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders the auditor to conduct an independent examination of the matter. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Oregon Department of Revenue, the Department of Insurance, the Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Retail Strategy Task Force, the Bureau of Economic and Risk Analysis, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the\u00c2\u00a0Definitions\u00c2\u00a0of\u00c2\u00a0Advisers\u00c2\u00a0to\u00c2\u00a0Investors in\u00c2\u00a0The\u00c2\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commission\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0Exchange\u00c2\u00a0Commission\u00c2\u00a0in\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0Process of\u00c2\u00a0Design\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0places\u00c2\u00a0addressed\u00c2\u00a0investor\u00c2\u00a0interests\u00c2\u00a0with\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0assessment of the value of a property.\u00c2\u00a0In this case, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.
