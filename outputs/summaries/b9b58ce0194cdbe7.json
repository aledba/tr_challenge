  "summary": "On June 21, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland entered a final judgment against Rina Calvo, a bus driver who was injured while driving from her home to work to attend a mandatory work training on a Saturday.  The court found that Calvo was entitled to compensation under the going and coming rule for injuries sustained while going to or coming from work.  According to the court's order, Calvo received a letter notifying her that she was scheduled to attend an important mandatory training scheduled for Saturday, May 16, 2015, at the Gaithersburg Depot. Calvo's trip took place on a day she did not normally work, and she was required to report to work on a different day. The court also found that the trainings took place much less frequently than expected, and Calvo did not participate in the training.  Calvo also was not required to attend the mandatory training because she was on her way to work at the time she was injured.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Maryland today announced criminal charges against Calvo. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Baltimore, charges Calvo with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's case, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering Calvo to pay a penalty equal to the amount of her earnings, and imposing a $10,000 civil penalty against her.  On June 22, 2018, the Court of Special Appeals granted the Commission's request for summary judgment in a related administrative proceeding. The Commission's investigation was conducted by Matthew R. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Alyssa L. Frank. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter in the Baltimore Regional Office. The Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Maryland Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Maryland Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
