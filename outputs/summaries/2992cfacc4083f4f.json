  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against the Illinois Department of Labor's (ILRB) unfair labor charge against the agency.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, in June 2015, the Illinois Labor Relations Board (\"ILRB\") issued a written order that imposed an unfair labor practice on employees who went on strike.  According to the complaint, the ILRB's order violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the agency violated the anti-fraud provision of Sections 10(a)(1) and 13(b)(2) of\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0Labor Relations Act of 1940 (\"Securities Act\").  The complaint also alleges that in violation of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, the employer's obligation to pay the employee's share of their health insurance premiums during a strike, and the obligation of the employer to reimburse the employee for the full cost of their premiums.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's action, the agency consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $10,000, $20,000 in disgorgement, and $1,500 in prejudgment interest. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On November 9, 2015, a federal judge in Chicago issued an order imposing an injunction, freezing the assets of AFSCME, and ordering the company to pay an $80,000 civil penalty. The court's order also imposed a $50,000 administrative penalty.  Last week, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against a Chicago-based company accused of violating the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar against the company, as well as an officer and director bar against future violations. The SEC also seeks a temporary restraining order, an injunction from future violations, and an order freezing the company's assets.  A hearing is scheduled for December 21, 2016, for which the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a business using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0check tool.
