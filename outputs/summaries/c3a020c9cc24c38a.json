  "summary": "On March 26, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana entered a final judgment against former Indiana State Superintendent Daniel Tanoos, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, alleges that, from June, 1993 through May, 1996, the Indiana State Board of Accounts charged a former state representative with bribery for soliciting, accepting, or recommending bribes from a vendor that repeatedly contracted with and provided energy solutions to the school district.  According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that from at least June through May of 1996, Samuel R. Turpin solicited, accepted, or agreed to accept $364.65 for a dinner at Mo's Steakhouse in downtown Indianapolis that was attended by a school board member and a family member or friend.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Turpin.   The complaint also alleges that the Indiana Secretary of State's Office issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the SEC's investigation of the alleged bribery, which was conducted by the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations' Risk Analysis and Detection Center. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily identify whether they are being targeted by the SEC by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly identify whether there is a quid pro quo.  For example, the SEC\u00c2\u00a0recently issued an Investor Alert about potential violations of the anti-bribery provisions of the federal securities laws.  Investor Alerts should be on the lookout for signs of suspicious activity or suspicious activity.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has obtained an asset freeze and other emergency relief.
