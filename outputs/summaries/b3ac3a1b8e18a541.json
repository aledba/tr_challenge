  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment in favor of the Indiana Attorney General's Office in a related criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, alleges that, in March 2015, Alberto Rodriguez was charged with a class A misdemeanor operating while intoxicated and class C misdemeanor operating a vehicle with an alcohol concentration equivalent of.08 or more. The complaint alleges that Rodriguez entered into a fixed-term plea agreement in which he agreed to be sentenced to a sentence of 30 months in prison and a work release placement of forty-two months. According to the complaint, Rodriguez agreed to the terms of the agreement and agreed to a three-year work release. The court accepted Rodriguez's plea agreement without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. Rodriguez also agreed to pay a $75,000 civil penalty and to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Rodriguez has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $5,000 and a civil penalty of $50,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Rodriguez arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint. The SEC complaint charges Rodriguez with violating Section 35-35-1-17, which provides for the right to sentence modification when a court accepts a plea agreement, and seeks a permanent injunction against Rodriguez from violating those provisions. In addition, the complaint seeks a temporary restraining order against Rodriguez, an officer-and-director bar, and a conduct-based injunction prohibiting Rodriguez from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Indianapolis Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson."
