  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against WeVeel, LLC, a Pennsylvania-based company that failed to produce financial and sales reports to the Trustee in violation of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that, from at least February 2017 through at least March 2018, weVeel violated Rule 37(b)(2)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.  According to the complaint, the SEC alleges that the Truste failed to provide sufficient information to the Court to determine whether it was substantially justified in withholding the financial and financial reports.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that in its initial response to the SEC's subpoena request, we Veel provided the SEC with a list of documents that it had not produced, including sales reports for Scentos Markers, Sidewalk Tattoos, Kindercrafts, and Best Friends.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, We Veel consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the Exchange Act and orders it to pay $24,689.00 in fees and $1,608.88 in expenses, including attorney's fees, for the purpose of recovering the allegedly ill-gotten gains of the alleged misconduct.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Weveel.  On May 24, 2018, the court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered the unsealing of documents related to the alleged fraudulently withheld documents, including financial statements and tax returns, in a parallel administrative proceeding.   The court also ordered the SEC to conduct an independent examination of the records in its possession, which will determine whether they are relevant and appropriate to determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties that the court may impose.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-3983 (Feb. 14, 2018).  The Court also issued an order suspending the issuance, purchase, offer and sale of securities in the securities industry, and ordering the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael Pecci and supervised by Amy C. McKinley of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Pecci. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Philadelphia Office of Financial Regulation, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office."
