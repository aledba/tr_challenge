  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado today entered a final judgment against a defendant who claimed that a trial court erred in denying him a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim for a new trial.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, Colorado, alleges that the trial court violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Skivington, who was a resident of the Mobile Stroke Unit at the time of the stroke, signed an agreement with UC Health that provided that he would receive medical services in exchange for his agreement to pay for that treatment. The complaint alleges that UC Health had mistakenly identified him as the patient who had received the medical services at issue. The trial court denied the defendants\u2019 motion to proceed with a hearing on the merits.  In its judgment, the court found that the defendants had violated the reporting provisions of Sections 13(a)(1)(A) and 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and that the parties had failed to adequately disclose the relevant facts in the complaint. The court also found that defendants could not, with reasonable diligence, respond to a motion for new trial without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint. In a parallel action, on March 2, 2019, a federal district court in Colorado entered a judgment against the defendants, ordering them to pay $30,536.10 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount owed to the defendants. The judgment also ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to jointly and severally disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interests. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Colorado Department of Insurance, and the Colorado Office of Financial Regulation."
