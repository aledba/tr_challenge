  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Devin Sawyer for his role in the death of a two-and-a-half year-old child.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, from at least 2011 through 2012, Sawyer, then a resident of a suburban Atlanta apartment complex, engaged in a long-running verbal tussle with a detective who claimed to be Weeks\u2019 father. According to the complaint, the detective told the detective that Weeks had been riding on the back of a four-wheeler and had hit his head on poison ivy. The complaint alleges that Weeks was not breathing and had been hit by a car. The SEC alleges that the detective allegedly used a knife to stab Weeks in the face and kicked him in the head.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today filed criminal charges in the case against Sawyer.  Among other things, the SEC charged Sawyer with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Sawyer consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to be restrained and restrained from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2019, the Honorable Amy C. Welshhans of the New York District Court granted the SEC's motion for a temporary restraining order against Sawyer and ordered him to be enjoined from future securities law violations.  A hearing for the final judgment is scheduled for June 5, 2019.
