  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against a Centralia, Illinois man accused of defrauding his wife by falsely claiming that he had a successful business and that he was financially independent.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that James Rushing, a self-employed heating and cooling business owner, and his wife, Jamie Rushing (n/k/a Emily Rushing), fraudulently induced the court to reduce James' child support obligation from $467 per month to $170 per month.  According to the complaint, James falsely claimed that he and Jamie had a joint income of $2336 per month when in fact they had no joint income.  James also allegedly claimed that his wife had no other source of income, and that she had been living at the same address since 2010.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, contrary to James' claims in his affidavit, Jamie had not purchased any real estate together since they married on January 2, 2014, and had no children.  As a result, James was unable to pay child support to Jamie, despite having a joint checking and joint savings account.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, James consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his child support owed.  On August 17, 2016, the court granted James' motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to produce the 2015 unredacted tax return within 14 days of the court's order. The court also ordered James to submit an amended financial affidavit and an amended joint income tax return in the same order.  After the court agreed to this order, James filed a second motion to reconsider and reopen proofs, seeking to have the court order James to pay back the $467-per-month child support he owed to Jamie.  Finally, on January 4, 2017, a federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, entered an order requiring James to comply with a court order that he pay back $467 of child support due to Jamie in a year.   The court granted the motion to revoke the order and order Jamie to pay $467 in child support, which is the same amount owed to James in the prior court order, and ordered James and Jamie to jointly pay $112 per month in child and family support.  This order requires James to provide a copy of the 2015 tax return that is the subject matter of the present court order."
