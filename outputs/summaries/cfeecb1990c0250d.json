  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California yesterday entered a final judgment against Fitness International, LLC, a California-based company that operated a health club shower facility.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, alleges that Fitness International failed to adequately protect its members and employees from potential liability for gross negligence.  According to the complaint, Anderson, who was a member of L.A. Fitness's staff, failed to disclose to members that he had fallen in the shower room and had been injured.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, despite knowing of the risks associated with the shower facility, Anderson failed to take steps to mitigate those risks, such as installing shower mats, friction strips, handrails, and handrailings on the shower floor.  Anderson also allegedly failed to show that, prior to his September 2 fall, he had previously fallen in a shower room.  As alleged, Anderson had previously complained to the staff about the risk in using the shower, and, after each fall, had notified the staff at the front desk of the dangers.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Fitness International agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Additionally, Fitness agreed to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Los Angeles Regional Office by Michael J. Gershfeld and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Enforcement's Asset Management Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the California Department of Insurance, and the California Office of Inspector General in this matter."
