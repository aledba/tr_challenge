  "summary": "The U.S. Department of Education (DOE) today announced that it has obtained a final judgment in a collective bargaining agreement between two colleges that imposed a 15-year hiring cap on part-time faculty.  The DOE's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, alleges that, in violation of Section C(10) of the Massachusetts Public Sector Labor Law, the College Board of Trustees (BHE) improperly intruded on the right of the college to hire full-time part-tim faculty. The BHE's complaint alleges that the college boards of trustees violated the right to collective bargaining by exceeding the maximum number of part time faculty in certain academic departments.  According to the complaint, the colleges also failed to meet their obligations to the BHE by not hiring full-tim teachers.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the college board of trustees for its role in this matter.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the DOE's Complaint, the Board of Higher Education has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the college from violating the federal, state, and local collective bargaining provisions of the federal securities laws. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-11 (January 16, 2014).  The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Greenbaum and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Lynn. \u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office, and the Massachusetts Office of Education and Professional Regulation."
