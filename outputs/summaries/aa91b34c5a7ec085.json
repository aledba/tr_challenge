  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against the Chicago Police Department and its former head of internal affairs for defrauding the public.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, in 2011 and 2012, the Illinois Attorney General's Office (AGO) issued an order to vacate an arbitration award that required the city to preserve records of alleged police misconduct that were more than five years old and denied the FOP's counterpetition to enforce the award.  According to the complaint, the AGO's order violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 16(a) in the Illinois Department of Public Safety (\"DPS\").  The complaint also alleges that the city and CPD violated Section 8.4 of the DPS arbitration award, which required the destruction of records related to alleged officer misconduct.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's action, the city agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to comply with the court's order. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the federal district court that issued the order issued a temporary restraining order against the City of Chicago from destroying or destroying any of the records in its possession. The court also granted the city's request for a preliminary injunction, which is pending final approval by the court.  On May 24, 2018, the U. S. Attorney for the Central District of Chicago filed criminal charges in connection with the same action.  A federal court granted the City's motion for a partial injunction against destruction of documents related to officer misconduct, and a federal court entered an order requiring the destruction and destruction of such documents. The order also prohibits the destruction or destruction of any records that are not in the public interest and from being used as evidence in a criminal investigation. The complaint charges the city with violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The investigation was conducted by the Chicago Regional Office under the supervision of Eric Werner and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the FBI"
