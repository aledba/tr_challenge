  "summary": "On March 2, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Orleans entered a final judgment against Horizon River Restaurants, L.L.C., a company controlled by Joshua Bruno, that permanently enjoins Appellee from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also granted the company's request for preliminary injunctive relief.  According to the court's order, filed on March 8, 2018 and unsealed on March 9, 2019, Horizon River and its owner, Scott Davidson, agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In its order, the court found that the defendants had violated the anti-fraud provision of the lease by failing to comply with certain of the obligations under the lease, including that West Centro and Mr. Bruno had defaulted on certain of those obligations, including rent payments owed to the Sheriff's Office pursuant to a court order, and that Horizon had failed to maintain its peaceable possession of the premises.  On March 10, 2018 the court granted the defendants' request for a preliminary injunction, which prohibits them from violating any of the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $487,487.50, a civil penalty of $1,000, and a $500,000 civil penalty for each of those violations.  Additionally, the order prohibits Horizon from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in the securities industry and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including in connection with the sale of or purchase of a home.  Without admitting to the SEC's findings, Horizon agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the securities laws and ordering it to pay civil penalties of $2.5 million and $1 million, respectively.  Horizon also agreed to pay a $100,000 penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval.
