  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former employee of the Social Security Administration who was found disabled by the agency in 2014.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia on February 24, 2018, Thomas Bruce, of Wayne, Pennsylvania, filed a Request for Review (RFC) in support of his claim for supplemental security income under Title XVI of the federal Social Security Act.  The complaint alleges that the Commission improperly concluded that plaintiff was not disabled because he had a severe impairment in the areas of \"understanding, remembering, and applying information\" and \"adapting or managing oneself.\"  As alleged in the complaint, the Commission also improperly discounted the severity of plaintiff's mental impairments and failed to consider whether there was sufficient evidence to support the Commission's finding.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Bruce.  On February 25, 2017, the SEC filed a Complaint against the Commission for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, Bruce consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders him to pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $1,000.   The Commission's order also prohibits the Commission from issuing an order imposing a bar on the individual who is found to be disabled.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 13, or No. 17, 2017. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David M. Welshhans and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Pennsylvania Department of Health, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
