  "summary": "On May 28, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Magellan Health, Inc.'s (Magellan) former vice president of account management for the pharmacy rebate management business.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that Magellan violated the antifraud provisions of the Pharmaceutical Benefits and Contracts Act of 1940.  According to the complaint, Magellan agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint.  Magellan also agreed to pay a $30 million civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against the former Magellan employee.   The complaint further alleges that, while Magellan was engaged in the business of pharmaceutical rebate management, Larweth solicited and obtained competing business from Magellan's clients in violation of the restrictive covenants.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the non-competition provision is overly broad because it prohibits certain employees from participating in the purchase, offer, or sale of any product or service that is not part of a pharmaceutical rebate program.  For example, the complaint alleges that Larwish solicited, received, and obtained business from a Magellan customer in violation, and failed to fulfill his obligations to the customer.  Finally, the Complaint alleges that Caceci was one of the Magellan employees who actively engaged in this conduct, and that he was the one who was tasked with ensuring that the customer signed the appropriate covenants when Magellan did not enforce them.  Cacaceci and Sak agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Without admitting to these violations, Cacacci agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions, requires him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders him to return to the company where he was employed.  Additionally, the judgment requires Magellan to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10 million. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Robert S. Weiss of the Boston Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by James L. Gibson and Antonia L. Gottschall."
