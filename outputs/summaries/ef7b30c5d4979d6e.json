  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against Great Lakes Anesthesia, P.C., a private company that provided anesthesia services to the hospital.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the company from violating the anti-fraud provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the federal securities laws.  According to the court's order, filed on August 4, 2016, the O'Bryans were hired by Great Lakes to perform anesthesia services for the hospital in Grant County, Indiana. The court found that Great Lakes had a protectable interest in providing anesthesia services at the hospital, and that it had a reasonable likelihood of success in enforcing the non-compete covenants.  In its order, the court also found that the company had a duty to protect the interests of the patients of the hospital and that the obligation to protect those interests was \"virtually impossible to quantify the profits diverted\" when a patient had been referred to the Hospital.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, Great Lakes consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of the company's profits.  Great Lakes also agreed to pay a $75,000 civil penalty, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the court.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Hannum Wagle and Cline Eng'g, Inc. and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Indiana Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
