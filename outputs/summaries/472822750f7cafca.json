  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment against William Shortway, a Victoria, British Columbia man accused of defrauding his wife by failing to seek judicial review of a final court order on child support and a parenting plan.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on October 17, 2012, William filed a motion in the superior court against the Department of Social and Health Services, Division of Child Support, charging him with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that William failed to seek proper review of the Department\u2019s final order and instead filed a civil injunctive action.  In its judgment, the court found that the Department lacked the jurisdiction to enter an order and ordered William to pay $400 in child support plus $421.70 per month in day care expenses.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, William consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $400. The judgment also prohibits William from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the order. The court also granted William the right to seek a preliminary injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4), of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3)(3) the Securities Act of 1933. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the British Columbia Department of Health and Human Services."
