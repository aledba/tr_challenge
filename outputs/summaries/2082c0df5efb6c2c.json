  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York today entered a final judgment against Michael E. Talassazan, Esq., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 12 months in prison for his role in a 2014 prison riot.  According to the court's order, filed on March 18, 2019, Talassazo agreed to settle the SEC's charges by agreeing to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his disgorgement plus prejudgment interest.  The court also agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $1,000,000 in attorney's fees and a $100,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Connecticut today announced that it filed criminal charges against the convicted felon.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, charges TalAssazan with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar against him.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the SEC has agreed to a permanent injunction, to the imposition of a civil monetary penalty, to be determined by the court at a later date. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David A. Rymas and Eric R. Werner of the New York Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the U.N.
