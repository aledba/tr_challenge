  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Hector L. Casablanca, a Connecticut man charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Hartford, Connecticut, alleges that, on May 23, 2016, the court granted the defendant's motion to compel the court to issue a judgment requiring the defendant to sign a required qualified domestic relations order (QDRO) and granting the defendant the right to compel him to sign the QDRO. According to the complaint, the defendants entered into a separation agreement in which the parties agreed to equalize their retirement assets and the amount of their social security benefits. The SEC alleges that the parties entered into the separation agreement with the intention of equalizing the husband's and the wife's retirement assets, and that, in the absence of any ambiguity or uncertainty, the parties' intent in agreeing to this provision was not to violate the federal securities laws. The court found no ambiguities in the agreement, and instead granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the defendants from raising any questions about the nature of the agreement or the intent of the parties, and ordered the defendants to comply with the court's order. The defendants agreed to settle the SEC's action by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of $242.75 plus prejudgment interest of $922.75 and a civil penalty of $192.75. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Connecticut today announced criminal charges against the defendants. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Asset Management Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Connecticut State Attorney General's Office."
