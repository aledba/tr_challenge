The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas, alleges that, on April 20, 2016, appellant approached T.S.'s home around midnight and demanded that she come with him.  According to the complaint, after she refused to leave her home, appellant allegedly took her into the living room and began to rape her.  As alleged, the alleged rape occurred on the night of March 11, 2014, when she was ill with bronchitis and had stopped to rest on the steps of her home.

Carter also agreed not to be associated with any of the other alleged rapes that he had committed pursuant to Arkansas Rule of Evidence 404(b).  In addition, Carter agreed to a five-year bar prohibiting him from representing himself as a lawyer or practicing as a public figure and from making material misrepresentations to the SEC in the course of a criminal trial.  A hearing on June 27, 2017 was held to consider the merits of Carter's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 5b-14 thereunder.
