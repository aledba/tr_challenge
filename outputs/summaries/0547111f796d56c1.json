  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against Michigan-based Severstal Dearborn, LLC (Severstal) in a civil injunctive action brought by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (DEDQ) on May 12, 2014.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Detroit, Michigan, the DEDQ issued a permit to install a blast furnace and three air pollution control devices at Severstal\u2019s steel mill. The permit was issued for an existing source. The complaint alleges that, in 2006, MCL 324.5505(8) and MCL 323.5506(14) provided that a person may appeal the issuance or denial of an operating permit for existing sources by filing a petition for judicial review within 90 days of the final permit action.  The complaint further alleges that in 2008 and 2009, the DEQ issued an order requiring Severstal to file an application for a permit for a new source, which was later denied by the court.  In 2014, the court granted the request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Sender to cease and desist from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also granted the motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Rea, Sonia S. Margulies, John Rymas, and Glenn S. Gordon of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Amy C. Welshhans. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Secretary of State's Office, and the Michigan Attorney General's Office in this matter."
