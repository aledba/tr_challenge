  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against the Trust for its alleged misconduct in a fee petition.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, alleges that the trial court improperly awarded the Trust legal fees in the amount of $285,000.  According to the complaint, the Trust's attorneys charged their client approximately $240,000 to participate in a mediation process that dealt almost exclusively with advancing a solution to the stormwater problem in the Heidler Road area and had nothing to with the condemnation proceeding and little to do with resolving the fees petition. The complaint alleges that, as a result of this conduct, the trust was not entitled to recover any fees and costs from its litigation.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has issued an order requiring the Trust to pay a civil penalty of 10% of the legal fees it incurred to litigate the Fee Petition.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's Complaint, the Court of Common Pleas of Pennsylvania issued an Order suspending the Trust from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney and ordering the court to consider the merits of the case. The order also prohibits the Trust and its attorney, Steven Tasher, from participating in any proceeding that is not related to the litigation of a fee Petition. The court also ordered the Trust not to pay any fees or costs to the trustee in its litigation, and instead to reimburse the Trustee for the fees incurred in its response to the Township's condemnation of Trust property.  On December 16, 2012, four days after the Township filed its initial Fee Petition, the court found that the Trust violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Court also ruled that, based on the facts of the matter, the trustee was entitled to a reasonable fee award based on its ability to pay the fees it sought to recover from the Township.   The court's order also imposed a temporary restraining order, which temporarily enjoins the trustee from future violations of the federal securities laws, and requires the trustee to provide a copy of the Commission's order to the receiver of the trust's property to determine whether to proceed with a civil proceeding.  Additionally, the order prohibits the receiver from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in the sale of a property without a court order, and from imposing a fee on the receiver.
