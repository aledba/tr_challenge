  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a medical malpractice defendant for his role in the death of Morley Reed Sprague, an elderly man who suffered from advanced multiple sclerosis (M.S.) and paralysis of his lower extremities.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, Sprague was admitted to Avalon Care Center for the purpose of treating him with pressure ulcers. The complaint alleges that Sprague suffered from a pressure ulcer on his right buttock and was unable to reposition himself while sitting or lying down. The SEC alleges that the trial court improperly allowed Sprague to testify to the standard of care of a wound care nurse without admitting that he had reviewed the medical bills and that his testimony was not consistent with that standard.  The complaint further alleges that when Sprague's family removed him from Avalon, he never fully recovered.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Utah today announced criminal charges against Sprague.  As alleged in the complaint, the SEC obtained a temporary restraining order and an order freezing the assets of the defendant and imposing a civil penalty of $2 million.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered a hearing on the matter. The court also issued an order suspending the defendant from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an expert in any matter that involves the subject matter of a medical professional's professional conduct.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David G. Campbell and supervised by Scott E. Burt of the Salt Lake Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Campbell, Ms. Gartner, and Mr. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Utah Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
