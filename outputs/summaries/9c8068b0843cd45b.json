  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment in favor of the City of Fort Wayne and the Auditor of the District of Columbia in a related administrative proceeding.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, on June 14, 1987, the city effected a series of fifteen annexations of territory, formerly located within the District.  The complaint alleges that the city was entitled to receive tax revenues from these annexations when it was not entitled to the tax revenues.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the City failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and instead relied on the date limitation in its motion for partial summary judgment, which was denied by the trial court.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the city.  On January 1, 2019, the court granted the City's request for summary judgment and denied the District's motion for preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the city's allegations, the Court also granted the District and Auditor's requests for preliminary and permanent injunctions against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the City to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000 and a $100,000 civil penalty, respectively, for each of those violations.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, and the Indiana Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
