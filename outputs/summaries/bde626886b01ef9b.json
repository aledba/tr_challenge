  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a civil injunctive action brought by two other defendants in a related criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Raymond, New Hampshire, alleges that Kenneth T. Riso and Rocco Riso, Jr. violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that Riso failed to disclose to the defendants that he had signed two checks that were purportedly written at his mother's request while she was in the hospital prior to her death. The SEC alleges that, based on these findings, Riso had forfeited his limitations defense by failing to timely respond to the SEC's motion for reconsideration.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the respondent delayed the filing of his response until after trial, when he knew that his mother had requested him to be reimbursed for expenses related to work he had done on the property.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $65,000, prejudgment interest of $8,825, and a civil penalty of $10,000. The judgment also prohibits Riso from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the issuance of a subpoena. The court also ordered Riso to pay a $20,000 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.  Riso agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the securities laws. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  A hearing is scheduled for March 20, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 24, 2018).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Boston Regional Office.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Gregory R. Ricchiute and Ms. Gibson under the supervision of Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Massachusetts Office of Financial Regulation."
