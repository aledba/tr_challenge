  "summary": "On May 24, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a final judgment against the City of Houston and various individuals alleged to be city officials in their official capacities to challenge the constitutionality of amendments to the Fund's governing statute.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Houston, Texas, the Texas Legislature passed and implemented a provision of the Texas Constitution that requires the Fund to provide retirement and related disability and death benefits for public officers and employees.  The complaint alleges that the City and the Fund violated Section 67(f) of the federal securities laws by failing to allocate the funds in accordance with that provision.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the city and the fund consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating these provisions.  In addition, the court granted the City's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, and ordered the City to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1.2 million.  On May 26, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the city, charging it with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 5b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting violations of Section 13B of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder. The SEC's investigation was conducted by David Robinson, Karen Cisneros, and Michael Kubosh of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The Commission on Civil and Administrative Rules, which administers the Texas Securities and Exchange Act, requires the SEC to obtain a court order imposing a temporary asset freeze and requiring the SEC and the Texas Department of Licensing & Regulation to conduct an independent examination of the proposed pension system. The court will determine the appropriate remedies.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-20-2017.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation."
