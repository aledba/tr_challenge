  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against a Kentucky-based research scientist who was charged by the University of Kentucky with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Louisville, Kentucky, alleges that Dr. C. William Helm, a Kentucky resident, made material misrepresentations to a colleague in submitting his own Center on Environmental Genomics grant application in 2009. According to the complaint, Helm failed to disclose that the university had not applied the research misconduct policy to the grant application, and that he had no legitimate claim of entitlement, and thus no property interest, in having the university follow its research misconduct policies. The complaint also alleges that Helm did not timely receive a copy of the 2015 Garfinkel DIO letter from the university, despite having received it the day before he filed the application. The SEC alleges that, contrary to these representations, Helm filed a fraud-by- omission complaint with the SEC on January 13, 2016, in which he alleged that the University improperly classified his plagiarism claim as \"internal\" rather than \"external.\" The complaint further alleges that in August 2011, the University exonerated Helm of the charges and closed its case with no further action.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Helm arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint.  On November 19, 2015, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against Helm from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The court also issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent investigation of Helm\u2019s alleged misconduct, which was conducted by staff in the Office of Research Integrity and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson, Ms. Karpel, and Ms. Ratterman.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kentucky Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Kentucky Office of Inspector General, and the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling them investments by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.
