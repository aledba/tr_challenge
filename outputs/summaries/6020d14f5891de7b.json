  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against New Prime, Inc., a Missouri-based trucking company, in a settled arbitration case.  The SEC's complaint alleges that New Prime violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that it violated the right to compel arbitration under the federal and state securities laws.  According to the complaint, New Prime spent more than four years litigating a threshold issue regarding arbitration with respect to the opt-in plaintiffs, and failed to convince the court that it could compel arbitration of the claims of putative class members, even if it had waived that right with regard to Oliveira individually.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against the company.  New Prime has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal, state, and local securities laws, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the company consented to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal securities laws and ordering it to comply with the court's order. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 17, 2019, the U. S. District Judge in the District of Columbia issued a temporary restraining order and ordered New Prime to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $100,000, respectively, to the class members in an uncertified class. The order also prohibits New Prime from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in a class action, and requires the company to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $2.5 million.  A hearing on June 24, 2019 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  An SEC hearing on July 5, 2019 is scheduled for 8:30 a.m., Eastern. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Attorney General's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 2019)."
