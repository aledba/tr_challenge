  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware today entered a final judgment against a Delaware man who was charged with violating his probation.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seaford, Del., alleges that on July 4, 2017, Officer Jamar K. Thompson of the Governor's Task Force was driving an unmarked sport utility vehicle in the area of Seaford when he observed what he described as an \"explosion\" in the front of the vehicle.  According to the complaint, Thompson told the officer that the car belonged to her and she would like to have it back.  Instead, the complaint alleges that the officer followed the car and followed closely behind the car, which was followed closely by a black sedan.  As alleged, the officer observed a large amount of green fluid on the windshield and leaking from the hood area.   The complaint further alleges that Thompson was not permitted to present his witness' testimony because the officer had recommended that he use his narcotic-certified dog to detect the green fluid coming out of the car.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Delaware today announced criminal charges against Thompson arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  Thompson agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Thompson consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to comply with the court's order, and imposing a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to a jury trial.  On August 4, Thompson pleaded guilty to a felony charge of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.  He was also ordered to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and ordered to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  A hearing scheduled for September 8, 2017 was rescheduled for September 9, 2017 to consider Thompson's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of his probation, ordering Thompson to surrender his firearm, and ordering the hearing to be conducted by a certified public accountant and a probation officer.  After the hearing, Thompson"
