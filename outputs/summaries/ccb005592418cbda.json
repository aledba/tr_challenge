The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that Arrow Electronics, Inc. (\"Arrow\"), a manufacturer and distributor of sports equipment components, violated Section 5 of the federal securities laws by failing to comply with certain of the provisions of the agreement.  According to the complaint, Arrow also failed to adequately disclose to the court that it was liable for breach of contract and that it owed it a duty to perform under the contract.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Arrow has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions and orders it to pay disgorgement of $598,488, plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $150,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Arrow.  On January 24, 2018, the court granted a temporary restraining order and entered a judgment against Arrow, ordering it to disgorge its alleged ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  To learn more about contract-based injunctions, see Litigation Release No. 5/2-105 (January 17, 2018).  The court also issued an order temporarily restraining Arrow from future violations of the anti-fraud provision of Section 5(b)(5) and ordering the company to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $100,000, respectively, for violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 10(d) and 13d-1 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\") and Rule 13a-14 thereunder, and ordering Arrow to pay a $50,000 civil penalty.
