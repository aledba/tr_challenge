  "summary": "On June 28, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington entered a final judgment against Money Mailer, LLC, a franchisor/franchisee relationship, that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder, and orders it to pay a $100,000 civil penalty.  The SEC's final judgment, which entered final judgment on June 29, 2018, orders the company to pay $150,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of the company's profits.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the company.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Seattle on June 27, 2019 and unsealed yesterday, MoneyMailer agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations in its final judgment.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by James F. Fuchs and supervised by Scott L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
