  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, the Department of Justice, and the California Department of Public Safety for violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, alleges that the Sheriff's Office violated the pre-investigative interview access provision of the MOU.  According to the complaint, the department's practice, which is mandatory, is not subject to the meet-and-confer requirements of the MMBA.  For example, the complaint alleges that, in 2003, the Sheriff issued an order requiring the department to provide pre-interview access to an investigative file before submitting to an interview by an internal affairs investigator.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the sheriff's order, which he issued on January 1, 2011, permanently enjoins the department from violating these provisions.  In a parallel action, the California Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against the department, charging the department with violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  On January 2, the court issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the department and ordering the investigation to be conducted by the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, with the assistance of the Division of Enforcement's Office of Inspector General, Criminal Investigations, and Public Finance Abuse Task Force.  A hearing on January 4, 2011 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  To learn more about pre-Investigative Interview Access, see Press Release No. 584, 797 P.3d 608.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the office of the Chief of the Public Safety Division and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC examination was conducted by Jennifer C. McKinley and was supervised by Marc Blau of the SEC Enforcement Division's Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Amy C. Hershfang.   The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.
