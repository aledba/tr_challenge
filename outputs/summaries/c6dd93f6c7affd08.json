  "summary": "On September 9, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia entered final judgments against Virginia-American Water Co. and Virginia Nat. Gas, Inc. (VAWC) in an emergency action to impose a water and wastewater infrastructure surcharge.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Alexandria, Va., the Commission approved a rate-adjustment clause in its 2017 order approving a $28,543,600 project to replace aging infrastructure.  The complaint alleges that the Commission failed to consider that the WWISC is just and reasonable and in the public interest, and that it is not subject to the statutory authority to approve the project.  In its order, the Commission found that, in its order approving the project, VAWC failed to meet certain of the statutory requirements for a rate adjustment.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the City of Alexandria and the Alexandria District consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin the Commission from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and order the Commission to issue an order requiring the payment of a $8.69 million civil penalty. The order also requires the SCC to approve a three-year pilot WWISC, subject to approval by the Commission.   The SEC's order, which was entered into on September 10, 2017, orders the commission to determine the appropriateness of the rate adjustment clause, the amount of any additional revenue, and the timing of any such payment. The Commission's order also imposes a $50,000 civil penalty for each violation of Section 5 of the Exchange Act. The complaint also orders the Commission not to interfere with the implementation of the proposed WWISC.  Finally, the order requires the SEC to determine whether any additional amount of additional revenue should be paid to ratepayers, with interest, in the form of a \"true up.\"  The Commission has not agreed to this order, and has not provided any guidance on how to proceed with this matter.  On September 12, 2018, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court in Alexandria seeking an emergency court order halting the construction of the Alexandria, Alexandria, and Alexandria Water and Sewerage Treatment Plants. The Complaint charges the Commission with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b-11 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer and director bar."
