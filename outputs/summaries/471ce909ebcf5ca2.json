  "summary": "The Pennsylvania Department of State's Office of Professional and Occupational Affairs today announced that it has obtained a court order to enforce subpoenas obtained by a Pennsylvania-based psychiatrist for the records of her former patient.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the Commonwealth Court in Philadelphia, alleges that Sarah G. DeMichele, M.D., provided psychiatric care to M.R. Sheppard Pratt Health System in Baltimore, Maryland.  According to the complaint, Dr. De Michele sought to enforce the subpoenas by requesting that a hearing examiner issue subpoenas for the testimony of Dr. Loewenstein, a member of the Board of Medicine, and a former treating psychologist, April Westfall, Ph.D. The court granted the subpoena request without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Dr. Leungenstein, Leung, Fine, and Westfall.  On June 10, 2016, the Pennsylvania District Court issued an order requiring the subpoena enforcement proceeding to be conducted by an agency of the Commonwealth, not a private party.

However, the court's order did not resolve the apparent inconsistency with the language of the MPA, and, instead, provided no basis for the imposition of a civil penalty or the costs of investigation.  Finally, the complaint alleges that the Board and the Bureau violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the reporting provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) in the Public Records Act of 1940 (\"PRA\").  The complaint also alleges that, in response to the Commission's subpoena request, the Board issued subpoenas against four private individuals and one private entity in order to obtain evidence in the sole possession of those private parties. The Commission's order also requires the Commission to show cause as to why it should not suspend, revoke, or restrict her medical license, and in the alternative, to grant a continuance of the proceeding in the case that the Commission obtained the subpoenaed records from the Commission pursuant to Section 761(a)(1).  The Commission has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the Commission from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders the Commission"
