  "summary": "On March 2, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of the trust against the trustee defendants for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and gross negligence.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, the Health Care Providers Self Insurance Trust, a group self-insured trust, was formed in 1992 to provide mandated workers' compensation coverage to employees of trust members (see Workers' Compensation Law \u00a7\u00a7'50(a) and (c) thereunder).  The complaint alleges that, in 2009, the trust was insolvent and was in dire need of emergency relief.  As alleged in the complaint, defendants made materially false and misleading statements about the trust's financial condition and failed to perform certain duties to the trust.  In addition, the complaint alleged that the trust had an accumulated deficit of over $188 million.  The court's final judgment, which permanently enjoins the trust from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders the trust to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the Trust agreed to a permanent injunction, to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $50,000, $100,000 and $100 million, respectively.  On March 4, the court granted the Trust's request for a temporary restraining order and an accounting and indemnification order.  Following the court's order, the trustees agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of an order permanently enjoining them from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) and of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 5b-5 thereunder.  A final judgment ordering permanent injunctions against further violations of Section 5(b) and the Advisers Advisers Rule of 1940, orders permanent injunctive relief against the defendants, and requires the trust and the trustees to pay an annual civil penalty in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the Trust.  For further information, see State of N.Y. Workers Compensation Bd. v. Kelly, No. 13-cv-01, No-1, No 2, and No. 527, no-3, no. 523, and no-4 thereunder; and, in the alternative, orders a temporary injunction against further violation of Section 15(b)(2) and Rule 15b2-1 of the Exchange Act of 1934.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Weissman and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry."
