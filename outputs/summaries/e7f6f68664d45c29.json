  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas today entered a final judgment against a former trustee who filed a second amended complaint in the Western Division of Florida.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in January 2016, Wyndham Worldwide Corporation (WWWC) and its then-chairmen, Peter Hernandez and Rob Hebeler, filed an amended complaint alleging that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC alleges that Embree's amended complaint, which was filed with the court without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, contained a short and plain statement of each of the defendants' claims, without providing any basis for the defendants\u2019 alleged improper conduct, and failed to provide sufficient notice of the specific allegations contained in the amended complaint. The court ultimately granted the defendants a temporary restraining order and ordered Embree to return to the district court.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Embree.  According to the SEC, Embree filed her amended complaint with prejudice as a shotgun pleading because it failed to adequately represent the defendants and the court understood the facts and claims presented in the complaint. In addition, the court granted Embree\u2019s motion to replead with prejudice on the basis that it had previously granted her leave to amend her complaint.  On May 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendants, charging them with violating Sections 8(a)(2) and (3) and 13(b)(5) and 14(a) and 15(a), and 16-21, and with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 8 and 10 of the Exchange Act and Rules 8b-20, 13a-1, 13b2-2, and 14a-13 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar. The defendants agreed to settle the SEC action by consenting to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and order them to pay civil penalties in the amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC. The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about shotgun pleading, see SEC Litigation Release No. 1322-23."
