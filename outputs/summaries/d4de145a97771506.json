  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment in favor of Mims, who was convicted of malice murder and other crimes related to the stabbing death of Dahyabhai Chaudhari during an armed robbery and of theft by bringing a stolen vehicle into the state.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that, on January 30, 2014, Christopher Sears drove his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s car, a green 2012 Kia Soul, to work in the Detroit, Michigan area. According to the complaint, Mims purchased the car and waited outside until all the customers and cars left to ask her about the car. Mims allegedly told the store clerk that she bought the car because she had always been aware of the charges against her and the possible consequences of her actions. The complaint alleges that Mims did not acquire the car when she stole it and instead used the stolen vehicle to drive around the country and steal it. The SEC also alleges that the car was used during the commission of the murder, when Mims was the aggressor, and when she was confronted by the car's owner, who confronted Mims and told her that she had \"blondish-brown, crinkly, curly\" hair and was not in her right mind at the time of the crime.\" Mims also allegedly claimed that, although she had never been evaluated by an expert or that a psychologist reviewed the record and formed an opinion as to whether she had a reasonable probability that the defendant would have accepted a plea deal, she did not show any due process violation from her absence at the hearing.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Mims arising from the same conduct that led her to be convicted of the same felony. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered Mims to surrender her passport, and ordered her to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Mims consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to return her passport. The final judgment orders her return to the U. S. to be followed by a hearing in which she will be sentenced on a permanent basis.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented"
