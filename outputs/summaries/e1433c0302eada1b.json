  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against Overaa & Co., a Pennsylvania construction company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b)(2) and (c) thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia on July 24, 2017, Overaa was required to provide a sample of its manufactured anthracite coal to a Pennsylvania company to determine if it was acceptable for the coal to be used as filter media in water treatment plants.  The complaint alleges that Overaa did not have any contracts with any Pennsylvania companies to supply the coal for the water treatment plant construction project and, instead, used Carbonfilt, a Florida company, to obtain the coal and sand it needed for the project.  As alleged in the complaint, overaa was not a credentialed testing laboratory and did not enter into any contract for the purchase of the coal from any Pennsylvania company.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the court agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Overaa from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement of $8 million, prejudgment interest of $1.2 million, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Overaa also agreed to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the District of Philadelphia today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On August 24, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Carbonite, alleging that the defendant violated the federal reporting requirements of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 12(b), and that the complaint was filed in violation of Rule 13a-14 thereunder, and the court found that the defendants violated the reporting requirements under Section 5(b).  The court also ordered Overaa to pay an $82,500 civil penalty, which is equal to the amount of the civil penalty that the company has paid to the court.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Philadelphia Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by John R. Rymas. \u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Department of Commerce, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office, the Philadelphia Office of Financial Regulation and the Pennsylvania Office of Inspector General."
