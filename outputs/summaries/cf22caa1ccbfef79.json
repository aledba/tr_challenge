  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a consent judgment against a defendant for unlawfully excluding a late-identified expert from testifying at a trial.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that David A. Smith II, a world-ranked collegiate high jumper who suffered several injuries, including a fractured left hip, was excluded from appearing at trial based on his failure to identify an expert witness who would testify at trial. The SEC alleges that Smith failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his claim for lost earnings and that he was not properly identified within the parameters of the scheduling order. The complaint further alleges that Lee failed to corroborate his testimony in his closing argument, and Smith was unable to capitalize on this unrebutted testimony to convince the trial court to impose a penalty. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against Smith.  According to the complaint, the SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Rymas and Eric R. Werner of the SEC Enforcement Division's Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Atlanta Division of Criminal Investigations. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.
