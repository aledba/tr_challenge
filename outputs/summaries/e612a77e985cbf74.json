  "summary": "On December 27, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Connecticut resident Kevin Ollie for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Ollo.  According to the complaint, Ollies, who was formerly employed as the head coach of the Connecticut men's basketball team, was informed that he was being terminated without cause by UConn. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, by refusing to pay the disputed fees, UConn is preventing him from exercising his First Amendment rights under the Exchange Act, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any product that constitutes an actual or imminent threat of harm to the plaintiff.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the court has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins UConn from violating the above-mentioned provisions and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Ollo also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay an $80,000 civil penalty. The court also ordered him to pay disgorgement of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a $50,000 penalty.  On December 28, Ollo filed a civil injunctive action against UConn, alleging that UConn violated the federal anti-fraud provisions and that the company violated the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The complaint also alleges that Ollo violated Section 10.3 of the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities, which requires a court to determine whether to suspend or revoke a defendant's right to an officer-and-director bar, and seeks a preliminary injunction, an injunction, and a permanent injunction against further violations of Section 5(b).  The Court also denied Ollo's request to participate in an administrative or judicial proceeding and ordered UConn to pay $20,000 in civil penalties, which Ollo consented to.  UConn agreed to pay"
