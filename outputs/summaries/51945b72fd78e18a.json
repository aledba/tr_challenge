  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Steven Zinnel and his accomplice, Derian Eidson, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, in a parallel criminal case, Zinnels and Eidson engaged in a money laundering scheme that included the use of fictitious entities and multiple layers of transactions.  According to the complaint, the defendants concealed from the bankruptcy court their interest in System 3, which was the basis for the $4 million buyout payment.  As alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Eidson was indicted for the act of concealing from the court his interest in system 3 and helped Zinnell funnel money from System 3 through Done Deal and her client trust accounts.  Eidson agreed to the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Financial Regulation today announced that it had obtained a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze to halt the alleged money laundering.  On May 2, 2020, the court granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction, entered an order appointing a receiver, and appointed a receiver to coordinate the receiver and receiver of the receiver. The receiver was named as a receiver by the court, and the receiver was appointed by the receiver at the time of the alleged scheme.   The court also appointed an assistant United States trustee, Edmund Gee, to provide background information about the receivers and coordinate the receivership of receiver assets.  Without admitting to the SEC, the receiver agreed to pay a penalty of 212 months, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and to a five-year officer-and-director bar.  After the receiver consented to the transfer of receiver-related property, the jury deliberated for a total of three hours before it was instructed to return a guilty verdict.  At the end of the deliberation, the judge gave Eidson three more minutes to complete the transaction before he was cut off.  He agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, to be barred from serving as an officer and director of a public company, and from participating in any offering of a penny stock or offering of any penny stock in the public company that is registered to offer and offer penny stock.  Finally, the district court agreed to impose a five year officer anddirector bar and to pay disgorgment of $1.5 million"
