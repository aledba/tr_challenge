  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Debra B. Marino, an attorney representing a client in a family proceeding, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that Marino violated Rule 4.4 of the Rules of Professional Conduct by filing a motion for a capias on the same day that the complaint was filed.  According to the complaint, Marino failed to check with the reviewing committee or the court's docket to see if the complaint had filed a \"motion\" for a deposition before filing the capias.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Marino consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay a penalty equal to the amount of her disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a separate administrative proceeding, Marino agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations.  On July 6, 2015, the court issued an order suspending Marino from appearing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering her to comply with the order suspending her from appearing for a hearing on the complaint.  As part of the settlement, Marino will be barred from appearing in the SEC case as a lawyer and from participating in any future SEC litigation.  To learn more about attorney disciplinary actions, see Litigation Release Release Release No. 17-cv-8221 (March 9, 2016).  The case is being supervised by C.J. Zelotes, Chief Disciplinary Counsel of the New York Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Office of Compliance, and the U.N. Office of Inspector General's Office of Criminal Justice."
