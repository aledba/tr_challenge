  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment against a Lynn, Massachusetts man who was charged with orchestrating a series of false and misleading statements in connection with three unrelated criminal cases.  According to the court's order, on March 24, 2017, State Police Trooper Matthew Wilson was dispatched to investigate a fatal stabbing in Lynn. Wilson conducted a pat-down of the defendant's home, located the cell phone in his pocket, and conducted an inventory search.

Grasso, Jr., C.M. McEvoy, and Thomas Reddy of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Messrs. Seng and Sansone. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.
