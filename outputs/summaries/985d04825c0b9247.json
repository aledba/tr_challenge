  "summary": "On June 26, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against Khepera Charter School and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia on April 24, 2019 and unsealed on June 6, 2019 in federal district court in Pennsylvania, Plaintiff alleges that, in violation of the federal securities laws, that the defendants failed to provide reasonable attorney's fees to all of their clients.  The complaint further alleges that defendants falsely claimed that their fees were reasonable when, in fact, they were not.  In fact, as alleged in the complaint, the defendants' fees were unreasonable because they failed to fulfill their obligations to their clients, including providing M.F. with a FAPE and, to that end, for paying the remaining $7,514 in compensatory education funds owed by the school district.  Additionally, the complaint alleges that Defendants failed to comply with their obligations under the IDEA and failed to pay their fees in the amount of $28,278.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and orders them to pay a $27,000 civil penalty.  PDE also agreed to pay $8,500 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amounts of its fees.  Finally, the court granted the defendants a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from further violating the anti-fraud provisions, and ordered the payment of civil penalties in the alternative.
