  "summary": "On May 24, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of Bhungalia Family, LLC (\"BFL\") in a civil injunctive action brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges that, on September 25, 2015, BFL filed a default judgment against defendant Deepak Agarwal for breach of a contractual obligation under Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 15b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the default judgment required BFL to pay $589,990.44 in attorney's fees and $13,798.63 in related expenses, including $41,888.58 in interest accrued as of September 24, 2016, and $968.34 in fees for the period from September 26, 2016 to the date of completion of the judgment.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the Exchange Act and Rules of Practice, and orders them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In addition, the court granted BFL's motion for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar.  BFL has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating Exchange Act Rule 15a-20, and ordering it to pay an $18,000 civil penalty.  On May 26, 2017, the Honorable John G. Koeltl of the New York District Court issued an order appointing a receiver for BFL, ordering the receiver to provide a copy of the Judgment to the receiver, and appointing an officer and director of the receiver.  A hearing on June 13, 2017 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17, 2013 WL 6571079.   The Commission's complaint charges BFL with violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(c) and with aiding and abetting violations of Rule 13a-14 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations and a penalty from BFL.  Separately, the Commission has issued an Order appointing an independent receiver for the receiver of BFL and ordering a hearing on Sep. 25, 2017. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0"
