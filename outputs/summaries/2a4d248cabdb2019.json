  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a New York City man who previously challenged the state's criminal prohibition on the possession of a handgun in the home without a license.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, on May 24, 2013, the New York State Attorney General's Office filed a civil injunctive action against a defendant for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The complaint alleges that, contrary to defendant's contention, New York's law imposes a mandatory minimum for a person over 16 years old to possess a handgun, including a valid, applicable license for his or her handgun.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendant for his role in the alleged scheme.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendant was also charged by the state with violating the federal securities laws, and the court subsequently issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendant's assets, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws and orders him to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by William C. Donnino and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. McKinley.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a business using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov."
