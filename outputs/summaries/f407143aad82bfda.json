  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of North Carolina today announced criminal charges against a North Carolina man who was denied a permit to carry a concealed handgun.  According to the SEC's complaint, Daniel Ryan DeBruhl submitted an application for a Concealed Handgun Permit on 9 September 2016 to the Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office. The complaint alleges that the sheriff's office denied the application on the basis of insufficient information provided in the complaint. The SEC alleges that, contrary to the representations of the complaint, the sheriff had not previously been adjudicated to be mentally ill and did not require a hearing to determine whether the applicant had a legitimate claim of entitlement to the permit. In fact, the complaint alleges, the Sheriff denied the permit because the applicant \"suffers from a mental health disorder that affects his ability to safely handle a handgun.\"  The complaint further alleges that in a parallel action, the FBI issued a perfunctory denial of the application for renewal on 14 December 2016, without notice of the nature of or basis for the denial or any opportunity for Petitioner to be heard on the allegations against him.  The SEC's Complaint, filed in federal district court in Charlotte, North Carolina, charges the defendant with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a related administrative proceeding, the SEC instituted a parallel criminal proceeding against the defendant.  On May 24, 2017, the Honorable Regan A. Miller entered an order denying the defendant's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the anti-fraud provisions, ordering the defendant to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000. The court also issued an order suspending the defendant from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any concealed handgun permit for a period of five years, and ordering the receiver of the permit to provide a copy of the final judgment to the receiver. The order also ordered the receiver to provide an accounting of the amount of money spent on the purchase and sale of a firearm. The receiver was not afforded any opportunity to respond to the complaint before the court entered its order."
