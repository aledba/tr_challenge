  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. (VW) in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the District of California.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, VW misrepresented its vehicles' high performance capabilities while asserting each vehicle fully complied with federal and state emissions standards.  The complaint alleges that, in reality, VW had installed \"defeat devices\" on the vehicles, which allowed the cars to meet emissions standards during testing, but, during the vehicle's normal operation, the software interfered with emission controls, resulting in actual emissions that exceeded EPA standards. The complaint further alleges that the defendants' claims were not preempted by federal law, as the complaint alleges, because they were not pre-empted by state law.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Department of Justice today announced criminal charges against VW for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the preemption provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2)(A) and 5(b)(5)(B)(3)(B) and of the federal securities laws. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On May 24, 2017, the Honorable Judge David L. Gade of the United Kingdom entered final judgments against VW, ordering the company to pay a civil penalty of $1,500, and ordering disgorging and prejudgment interests of $2,500.  Without admitting or denying the SEC allegations, VW consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin the company from violating the charged provisions, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, sale, or promotion of any federal or state law enforcement action. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Reglan Litig and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Litig. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Department of Health and Human Services."
