  "summary": "On February 2, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama entered a final judgment against Gerand Earl Ratcliff, a former officer of the Pleasant Grove Police Department, ordering him to comply with the court's order to suppress all evidence, statements, and other evidence obtained from three searches of his home and garage conducted by the Police Department of Pleasant Grove, Alabama.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, on November 3, 2015, the officers entered the house and entered the garage, where they found evidence of a car stolen in Mississippi and located at a specific Alabama address.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of the searches, Ratcliffs voluntarily consented to the entry of a search warrant, which authorized the officers to search the home and the garage.  In a parallel action, on April 13, 2017, a federal district court in Atlanta, Georgia, issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering Ratcliffe to surrender his right to a court-issued officer-issued search warrant.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court granted the court\u2019s order and ordered Ratcliffe to surrender all of the evidence, including the handgun, the bottle of pills, the marijuana in the toilet, and the cash in the safes. The court also granted the officers\u2019 motion to suppress the evidence in the search warrant application.  On March 14, 2016 at approximately 5:30 in the afternoon, three Pleasant Grove police officers, Corporal Duane Martin, Officer Samuel Powell, and Chief Robert J. Knight, entered guilty plea to all three counts of the superseding indictment, which included one count of possession of a controlled substance with the intent to distribute it. The judge granted the officer-involved search warrant request, which was granted by the court on April 12, 2017. The SEC alleges that the officers violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Additionally, the complaint seeks an officer-and-director bar, a penny stock bar, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17a-5(a) thereunder, as well as an officer and director bar.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (March 14, 2015).  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Andrew Reed and Daniel Reid in the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by"
