  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Maryland today entered a final judgment against Baltimore City Fire Department medics who were negligent in their treatment of a patient who died in a car accident.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Maryland, alleges that Baltimore City fire department medics, Joseph Stracke and Stephanie Cisneros, violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to adequately diagnose and treat the patient.  According to the complaint, the defendants were grossly negligent in the treatment of Mr. Butler, who was in cardiac arrest and had difficulty breathing and speaking.  In a parallel action, the Maryland Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against the medics.  On March 2, 2011, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, charging them with gross negligence in the course of performing their duties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the fire department and EMS personnel consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a $3,707,000 civil penalty.  Following the judgment, the District Attorney's Office issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of a case-by-case review that was conducted by the Office of Inspector General's Criminal Investigations, with the assistance of the Baltimore Office of Emergency Management's Office of Public Health and Inspections and Examinations Division.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the office of the Chief of the Department of Health and Human Services, and the case was supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Regional Director of the Maryland Office of Health Education and Advocacy.   The litigation will be led by Ms. Ganey and Mr. Strachan."
