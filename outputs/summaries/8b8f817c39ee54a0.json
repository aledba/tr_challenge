  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of West Virginia on January 10, 2017, entered a final judgment that permanently restrains the family court's December 16, 2015, order that ordered the Husband to pay $1,500 per month in cash-based income from his business, D.C. Services, to the wife.  The court also found that, contrary to the court's order, the husband did not properly report his business's labor costs and instead paid his employees in cash.  In addition, the court found that the husband failed to provide any corroborating evidence for the wife's claims that he paid his workers in cash and that he did not adequately report his labor costs to the state and federal governments.  As alleged in the court order, however, the wife failed to corroborate the husband's testimony and failed to support using a fifty percent formula to calculate his net income.  Without admitting or denying the facts of the case, the judge also ordered the husband to pay a civil penalty of $216.75 per month, which would be equal to the amount of cash income received by the husband in the year examined by the court.  On the same day, the Court issued a temporary restraining order against the husband from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the wife to comply with the order by consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering her to pay civil penalties of $2,531.89 per month and imposing a $500,000 civil penalty against her.  According to the order, filed in federal district court in the District of Columbia, the Honorable Carolyn M. Mascianica of the Court of Common Pleas granted the wife the right to return her husband's allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest and a penalty equal to her civil penalty.  To learn more about divorce proceedings, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (2014).  The Court granted the Wife's request for a preliminary injunction and ordered her to submit a copy of the final judgment to the Court for determination of her need for alimony in the future.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for February 24, 2017."
