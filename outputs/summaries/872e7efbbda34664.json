  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final consent judgments against a defendant for aiding and abetting a series of armed robberies of electronics stores in and around Detroit, Michigan.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, in February 2010, Frank Richardson, a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, aided and abetted one of those robberies.  According to the complaint, Richardson, who was sentenced to 1,494 months in prison for the Hobbs Act robbery and felon-in-possession convictions, used a gun during each robbery to commit the robbery.  As alleged, Richardson was not convicted under the mandatory sentencing provisions of the federal securities laws, and his conviction was not subject to the mandatory minimum sentence.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Richardson arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  Richardson has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,494, which is equal to the penalty imposed by the court in his first appeal.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Richardson agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the federal criminal laws, ordering him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty.  He also agreed to be enjoined from associating with any person or entity charged with a felony in connection with a crime of violence, and from participating in a public offering of a penny stock.  Finally, the court granted Richardson\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, ordered him to surrender his passport, and issued a limited remand.  On August 2, 2018, the Honorable Paul G. Sansone of the U.N. Office of Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued an order suspending Richardson from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Sansone agreed to the appointment of a receiver under the supervision of a federal judge.  To learn more about the receiver, see Litigation Release No. 522 (Jan. 24, 2018).  The Commission's Order suspending Richardson will be reviewed by the SEC Enforcement Division's Office of Criminal Investigations, which has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigational Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov."
