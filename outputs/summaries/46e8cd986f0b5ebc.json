  "summary": "On November 9, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment against the former Secretary of State and the Archivist of the United States for the purpose of recovering emails improperly removed from the State Department.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., on January 20, 2001, former Secretary Of State Colin Powell created and received work-related emails on a personal email account provided by AOL, Inc.  The complaint alleges that Powell's personal representative advised State that the private email account former Secretary Powell used during his time in office had been closed for a number of years, that he did not retain or make printed copies of the emails, and that there are no emails for State to recover.  As alleged in the complaint, the complaint further alleges that the Attorney General's Office called Powell's representative at the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to advise him that there were no emails in the AOL system from Powell's tenure as secretary of state.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Powell consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  In a parallel action, on January 26, 2005, the District Court entered a temporary restraining order against Powell and ordered him to comply with the court's order, ordering him to pay disgorgement of $1,078.71, prejudgment interest of $2,038.71 and a civil penalty of $100,000.  On February 13, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the Commission's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the federal records laws, and ordered Powell to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  Separately, the Commission issued an order requiring Powell to cooperate with the Commission in its investigation of the matter.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Andrew D. Kerry and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, the Department of Homeland Security, and the FBI in this matter."
