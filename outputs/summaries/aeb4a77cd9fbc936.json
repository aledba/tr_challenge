  "summary": "On October 30, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Derrick Nelson, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to life in prison for the 2013 death of his younger brother, Willie Hood, Jr.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, on May 4, 2013, Nelson and Hood had argued over the keys to Hood's car, which was parked in the driveway. According to the complaint, Nelson told the driver that he could have the car because he could get another one. The complaint further alleges that after Nelson fired the gun in the air, Hood grabbed Nelson's hand and tried to break the car's wind guard, which he later used to kick Nelson out of the car. The SEC alleges that Nelson then confronted the driver and told him to \"chill out\" because he was not trying to hurt him. The jury found Nelson liable for a second-degree murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Nelson arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On October 31, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Nelson, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Nelson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 2016-00835-COA, No. 619, 623 (Miss. 1984).  The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Mississippi Division of Criminal Investigations.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The case was supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Dunn. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom's Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Mississippi Department of Justice in this matter."
