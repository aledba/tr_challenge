  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Anita Middleton, a convicted felon, for her wrongful termination of her parental rights to her children M.H., F.M., and B.M. who range in age from nine to thirteen years old. The court found that Anita had failed to comply with the court's finding that she was at risk of both psychological and physical harm if returned to her parent's custody.  The court also found that, contrary to the court finding that Anita was in a stable home and had a long history of drug use, Anita continued to use methamphetamine, alcohol, and marijuana.  According to the Court's order, Anita was not rehabilitated and had not shown any ability to maintain stability in her home.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Anita for her role in a drug-related criminal case.  On May 2, 2018, the court entered a temporary restraining order halting Anita from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Anita consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and prohibits her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the termination of the parental rights of any of the children.   The Court also ordered Anita to pay disgorgement of her ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $150,000 and $75,000.  Anita also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school.  A hearing on May 24, 2018 was scheduled for 5:30 p.m. for Anita to be sentenced to 12 months in prison.  An examination that followed Anita's release from prison was conducted by Karen McLaughlin, and the case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Fort Smith Regional Office, with the assistance of staff from the agency's Office of Advocacy and Advocacy. \u00c2\u00a0The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. McKinley, Chief of the Fort Smith Office of Public Health, and Ms. McLaughlin are the CASA workers assigned to the case."
