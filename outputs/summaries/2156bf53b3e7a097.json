According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Miami, Florida, Jane Doe was harassed by two older men who repeatedly asked her to go into the boys' bathroom.  The complaint alleges that Jane Doe, who was a junior in high school at the time, was confronted by one of the men and told that she was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
