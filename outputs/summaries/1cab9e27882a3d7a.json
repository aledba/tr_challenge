  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Harker School District attorney Robert Bigler and two of his companies in a civil injunctive action brought by Shivani Bigler.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on June 10, 2011, filed in federal court in Santa Clara County, California, the Biglers and their companies violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The complaint alleges that, in 2010, when Shivani's parents were presented with an enrollment contract for the 2010\u20132011 school year, it was alleged that Itokazu had engaged in a \"take-it-or-leave-it\" conduct, which was inconsistent with current law and fair dealing, and that he had violated the arbitration provision of the contract.  As alleged in the complaint, however, that the Bigler's conduct was not inconsistent with the policies and practices of the school and the institution.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that in 2011, after learning that she had participated in an academic competition sponsored by the Rotary Club, She went to his classroom to \"share the news of her accomplishment\" with it.  She allegedly told him that she thought he would be happier for her than she was because he \"was so happy with her second-place finish.\"  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the two Biglers for their roles in the alleged conduct.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  On August 15, 2011 the court granted the Bigling's request for an emergency court order and ordered them to comply with the court's order.  Following the court order, the SEC filed an emergency action, including an order to halt the filing of the emergency action and to appoint a receiver to determine whether to proceed with the litigation.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Los Angeles Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Mascianica of the San Francisco Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority and the United States Postal Inspection Service."
