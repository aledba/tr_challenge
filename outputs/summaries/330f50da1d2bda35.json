  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Antwon Pitt, a convicted felon who was sentenced to 10 years in prison for orchestrating a series of high-level insider trading and insider trading that generated more than $1.5 million in illicit profits.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, on October 13, 2015, appellant entered the jury room and entered the room with his cousin, telling her that he had just been released from federal prison for a previous felony and that he would like to be removed from the case. The complaint further alleges that the jury was told that the criminal history of the defendant was not relevant to the case, and that the defendant did not commit the October 13 burglary or rape because he had been released on probation. The SEC alleges that this was false because the defendant had been previously convicted of a similar felony and had been sentenced to probation in 2013.  According to the complaint, the jury deliberated for nearly an hour before finding that appellant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the jury to consider whether to remove the defendant.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against appellant.  On October 16, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendant, charging him with violating Section 15(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2) and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder, and seeking a permanent injunction against further violations of Section 15a of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, appellant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078.95, prejudgment interest in the amount of $2,098.55, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  To settle the SEC case, the defendant agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to a five-year officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by David A. Schiff and Eric R. Werner of the Philadelphia Regional Office, with assistance from John R. Rymas of the Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
