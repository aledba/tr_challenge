  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arizona on August 22, 2018, entered a final judgment against Arizona resident Alberto Rodriguez, who was denied a security clearance in 2016.  The court's order, which was entered on consent, permanently enjoins Rodriguez from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced criminal charges against Rodriguez.  According to the SEC's complaint, Rodriguez was arrested on September 9, 2011, while driving from Arizona to California for a friend's birthday party. The complaint alleges that Rodriguez was denied security clearance because he had \"failed to comply with security regulations\" and had \"demonstrated a pattern of dishonesty and/or rule violations.\"  The complaint further alleges that on September 10, 2016, Rodriguez filed a second and third denial letters, which were also in violation of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Rodriguez consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains, and ordering the issuance of a third and fourth denial letters.  Rodriguez agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations of the securities laws, as well as to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security clearance. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Homeland Security. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Arizona Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Arizona Office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in this matter."
