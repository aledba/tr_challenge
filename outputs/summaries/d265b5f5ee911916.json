  "summary": "On August 20, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York entered a final judgment against John J. Griffin, Esquire, a criminal defense attorney who represented Andrew Carr, a defendant who was convicted of one count of conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine in separate cases but are members of the same conspiracy. As a result, Griffin is also disqualified from representing Carr on his appeal.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Griffin represented Carr on two separate occasions, during the Government's investigation of Carr's case and at Carr's sentencing hearing. The complaint alleges that, at the time of his representation, Griffin was retained by Carr and began working on Carr and Client No. 1. As alleged in the complaint, Griffin's concurrent representation of both defendants created a potential conflict of interest created by his concurrent representation.  The complaint further alleges that Griffin failed to adequately represent Carr at his sentencing hearing, and that, in the event Carr is retried, Griffin will not represent him at the retrial.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Carr.  On August 20th, the court issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order, prohibiting Griffin from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney, and requiring him to provide competent and diligent representation to each of the defendants at their sentencing. The order also prohibits Griffin from representing a defendant on his own, without the knowledge or consent of the defendant, without having a duty of loyalty to Carr or to the counsel of his choice.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Griffin consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000 and a civil penalty of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about conflicts of interest, see Litigation Release No. 206 (January 24, 2019).
