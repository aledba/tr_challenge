  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment in favor of the Indiana Products Liability Act against Bradley A. Estabrook, who was injured while working on a machine owned by his employer, General Products Corporation.  According to the court's order, in 2014, Estebrook was injured when he was working on the machine and was unable to complete the job due to a design defect.  The court found that the manufacturer had a reasonable incentive to repair or recondition the product and to make a \"new product\" after it was delivered to the initial user or customer.  As set forth in the order, however, the statute imposes a ten-year limitation on the amount of time a manufacturer can take to complete a product repair, refurbishment, or reconstruction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, Estobrook consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Estabrodok.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, charges Estabrobrook with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Pypka and Mr. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Indiana Department of Commerce, and the Indiana Office of Insurance Regulation."
