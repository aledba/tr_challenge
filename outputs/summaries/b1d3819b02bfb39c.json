  "summary": "On September 20, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Jason Alexander Phifer, who was convicted of possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance in violation of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Phifer violated the antifraud provisions of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Phifer consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, and agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the securities laws and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Phifer.  To learn more about the SEC\u2019s investigation, see Litigation Release No. 13-20-2018.  For more information on the SEC, see Press Release No: 13-21-2019.  On September 24, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations.  This case is being handled by Michael J. Pyszka of the New York Regional Office, under the supervision of Joseph G. Sansone, with the assistance of John Rymas of the Division of Criminal Justice. The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).
