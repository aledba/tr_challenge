  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland today entered a final judgment against the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Maryland, alleges that the federal government violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act by failing to comply with certain provisions of the federal health care law. The complaint also alleges that, in violation of Section 1554, the federal agency that administers the federal funds for family planning services, Baltimore City failed to adequately assess the impact of the proposed rule on its patients and residents. The SEC alleges that Baltimore City violated Section 1514 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\") when it issued the Advisers Advisers Rule in 1988, which prohibited physicians from counseling patients about abortion. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Department of HHS has agreed to the entry of a final rule that permanently enjoins Baltimore City from violating these provisions. The final rule, which is subject to court approval, requires that all federal funds be used for the purpose of providing safe, effective, and cost-effective services. The proposed rule also requires that providers provide a \"clear and reasonable explanation\" for why they should not perform abortions as part of a family planning project. The court's order also requires the Department to provide an accounting of the costs of performing an abortion.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Health Education and Advocacy today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting the implementation of the Final Rule. The Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. McShane and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Baltimore Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. McGlynn and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Scott A. Kasper.  For additional information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01253."
