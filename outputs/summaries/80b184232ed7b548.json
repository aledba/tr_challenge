  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Adolphus Black, a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for three drug-related felony convictions.  According to the court's order, in 2004, a jury convicted Black of three felony counts of possession of at least 200 grams of crack cocaine, in violation of the federal securities laws.  The court also found that Black was a \"covered offender,\" meaning that he was eligible for a reduced sentence based on the amount of drugs he had been convicted of.  In addition, the court found that the mandatory minimum for a covered offense is 240 months to life, and that Black had the opportunity on appeal and two motions under \u00a7 2255 to address the issue of whether he should be sentenced as a career offender.  As alleged in the complaint, however, Black was not a covered offender at the time he was sentenced.  Black's sentencing was scheduled for August 3, 2010, and he began serving his sentence for each of those counts on April 11, 1989.  On June 6, 2005, the Court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction against Black from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Black to pay a civil penalty of 240 months.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Black consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the First Step Act and orders him to pay civil penalties of up to 240 months, including a five-year mandatory minimum and a statutory maximum of forty years in prison.   The final judgment also prohibits Black from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of a penny stock, including securities in the securities industry, and orders the issuance of a cease-and-desist letter to the broker of the proposed settlement. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Eric R. Werner and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the Federal Office of Inspector General.
