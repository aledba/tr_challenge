  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a default judgment against Crystal Automation Systems, Inc., a provider of phone and internet services to residents living in and around the village of Edmore, Michigan.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Michigan, alleges that, from April 2003 through May 2016, defendant rented space on and near plaintiff's water tower for its antennas and equipment. The complaint alleges that defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that defendant failed to comply with certain of those provisions of the Exchange Act. The SEC alleges that the defendants violated Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of that Exchange Act and Rule 17a-3 thereunder and that defendants violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(2)(A) of Exchange Act Rules 5b2-3 and 5b4-4 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins them from violating Exchange Act Rule 5a-5, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against defendant.  On May 1, 2016, the court granted the SEC's motion for partial summary disposition against defendant and ordered defendant to respond by April 12, 2016. The court also granted the court's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against defendant, ordering defendant to remove its equipment from the water tower, and ordering him to pay reasonable attorney fees and the damages plaintiff had incurred in removing defendant's equipment. On May 2, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against defendant for failure to respond to the court order. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Eric R. Werner and supervised by Jan Folena of the Chicago Regional Office. The examination was conducted in the Office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Illinois. The investigation was supervised by Scott A. Kasper.
