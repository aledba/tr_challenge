  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm) finding that she was not entitled to uninsured-motorist (UM) coverage.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Little River County, Arkansas, Gara Cross was the permissive driver of Glenn Hankins's vehicle, which was insured by State Farm. The complaint alleges that Cross failed to present sufficient evidence to prove that both the driver and the operator of the vehicle were uninsured, and that the omission of the driver from the UM exemption violated public policy.  The complaint further alleges that when Cross was driving through construction zones and witnessed AHTD dump trucks dumping pea gravel onto the roadway, she lost control of her vehicle and was injured in a single-vehicle accident.  As alleged in the complaint, Cross's injuries did not arise out of the operation, maintenance, or use of an uninsured motor vehicle, but rather from the negligence of a driver of the other vehicle.  In its judgment, the court found that Cross violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered her to pay a penalty equal to the amount of her ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, Cross consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders her to comply with the entry and conduct of a court-ordered injunctive proceeding. The SEC's investigation was conducted by G. Couch and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Graham Loomis. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay."
