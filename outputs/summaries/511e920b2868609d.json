  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against a Cuyahoga County Board of Tax Appeals (BTA) finding that Spirit Master Funding IX, L.L.C., an Ohio-based private school district, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, the BTA erred by failing to consider the value of the subject property at the time of the August 2014 sale.  The court also found that the value provided by Racek in determining the 2015 valuation was not consistent with the values of the real estate.  In its order, which was entered without prejudice, the court found that Racek's appraisal was unreliable and unlawful, and that it would not consider the 2015 value.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, Spirit Master has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and ordering it to consider all of the issues raised in its order.  Additionally, the Court has issued an order suspending the sale of Bronx Park, Ohio, a private school located in Warrensville, Ohio.  It also ordered the school district to submit an appraisal of the property, which is subject to BTA approval, that it will consider when evaluating the property.  On May 2, 2018, the Ohio Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order against Spirit Master, ordering that it review its valuation and consider whether it is reasonable and lawful to consider a valuation of the unencumbered fee-simple estate based on the information provided by racek.   The Court also ordered that it consider whether to consider an independent valuation determination for the property that is relevant to the value under R.C. 5713.03, and whether it should consider an appraisal that is consistent with that determination.  Finally, on May 4, 2018 the Ohio Supreme Court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Spirit Master from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay disgorgement of $1,535,000 plus prejudgment interest of $2,925,000, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000 for each of those violations.  Separately, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Racek for his role in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The court also issued a preliminary injunction against future violations"
