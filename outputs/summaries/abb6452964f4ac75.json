  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California today entered a final judgment against Cenergy International Services, LLC (\"Cenergy\") and Cummings Consulting, Inc. (\"CCLLC\") for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Houston, Texas, alleges that Cenergy and Cenergy agreed to settle the SEC's charges by agreeing to pay $15,488.50 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their respective compensation.  Cenergy also agreed to pay a $20,000 civil penalty to be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.  According to the complaint, Cenergy's settlement agreement with Cenergy, which is subject to court approval, required Cenergy to sign a \"Master Services Agreement\" (MSA) as an individual that set out the rate of pay and described some of the rights and obligations of each party.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) and requires them to pay civil penalties equal to their compensation in the future.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On March 21, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against a Chevron-affiliated site manager, alleging that the company violated the federal securities laws by failing to comply with certain of the provisions of the MSA, including the right to reapply as an independent contractor in a future SEC case, and the obligation to pay reasonable attorney's fees and attorney's costs to the defendant.  Additionally, the complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 17(a)(1) of\u00c2\u00a0The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") as well as Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The complaint also alleges that, in violation of Section 13(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, Chevron violated Exchange Act Section 17 (2) and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder, and that the complaint seeks a permanent injunction against future violations.  Finally, the court granted Cenergy &rdr.gov's request for a temporary restraining order against further violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 12b"
