  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the Herrling family's motion for summary judgment in a related case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that the Court of Chancery issued a temporary restraining order on May 29, 2018, freezing the assets of Allomet Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its founder, Richard E. Toth.  According to the complaint, Toth and his wife Mirta (\"Mirta\") Toth, who resides in Switzerland, claimed to be the equitable owners of the original shares of stock in Allomet when, in 1962, the Cuban government forcibly seized the partnership, allegedly without paying any compensation. The complaint further alleges that Toth's wife and daughter-in-law, Anja Toth (\"Toth\"), and Toth were the beneficial owners of all of the shares. The court also ruled that the parties had the burden of establishing the substance of the foreign law under the Vienna, Austria law.  In its judgment, the court held that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the court had the duty to determine whether the parties were entitled to relief under Section 168 of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date. The judgment also orders Toth to pay a civil penalty of $250,000.  Toth agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 12(b)(3) of Exchange Act Rule 12b-20, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 30, 2018 the court issued an order suspending Toth from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States. The order also prohibits him from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, municipal bankruptcy court, or securities dealer. The Court also ordered Toth not to participate in any issuance, offer or sell any security offering in the name of the broker or investment adviser. The SEC is continuing its investigation into the matter. The case is being handled by Eric R. Werner and supervised by Jan Folena of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner."
