  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against 1st Auto Casualty Insurance Company, a Wisconsin-based insurance company, for failing to pay prejudgment interest to a third-party claimant.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seymour, Wis., alleges that, on August 24, 2013, the Estate of Kevin Payette and Natalie Payette of Seymour, Wisconsin, made a demand for $672,806.42 in pre-judgment interest.  According to the complaint, Payette was bicycling in the eastbound lane of County Trunk Highway VV, directly behind a vehicle hauling a horse trailer, when Payette's vehicle struck the horse trailer head-on.  Payette died immediately after the alleged accident, and the Estate was left owing $172,806 to the estate based on the amount of the alleged damages.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Wisconsin today announced criminal charges against the Estate for its role in the alleged scheme.    In its complaint, the SEC alleges that the Estate violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the estate consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of these provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of 12 percent per year, with disgorgement to be determined by the court upon motion of the Estate.  Additionally, the court granted the Estate a temporary restraining order against further violations of the securities laws and ordered the Estate to pay civil penalties of 12% per year. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Wisconsin Department of Insurance, the State Attorney General's Office, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Insurance Regulatory Surveillance Authority, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Wisconsin Office of Insurance Regulation (OIEA) in this matter."
