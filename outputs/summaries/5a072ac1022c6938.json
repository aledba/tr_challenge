The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Minnesota, alleges that Safeway and Fernandez violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that, in denying Safeway's request for a disgorgement of profits, the court improperly imposed an injunction preventing Safeway from using or contributing to the use of the trademarks.  According to the complaint, Safeway also failed to disclose that Fernandez was the rightful owner of the marks, which Safeway claimed were his and that he was entitled to resume use of them.

For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1749 (2014).  The complaint also charges Safeway with violating Section 15(a) of The Exchange Act and Rule 15b2-2 thereunder and with violating Exchange Act Section 1749 and Exchange Act Rule 15a-1.
