  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California yesterday entered a final judgment against Sears, Roebuck and Co. (\"Sears\"), agreeing to pay a $1.2 million civil penalty to settle a civil action brought by Dailey.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that Sears violated California's wage and hour laws, including those governing overtime pay and rest and meal breaks, with respect to its auto center \"Managers\" and \"Assistant Managers\" (collectively, the proposed class members).  According to the complaint, Dailey's claims were false because Sears' policies and practices did not apply to all members of the alleged class, and that the \"managers and assistant managers\" did not have the discretion to determine whether they were entitled to a 50-hour workweek.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Dailey misrepresented to Sears that he had 20 years of managerial experience while he allegedly had none.  Dailey also alleges that, contrary to Sears' claims, he was not a suitable class representative because he spent most of his time performing nonmanagerial duties.  As a result, the SEC's order, which was entered without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, orders Sears to pay $1,2 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of the civil money owed to the class members.  On the same day, the court issued a temporary restraining order against Dailey, freezing his assets, and barring him from appearing before the SEC as an attorney or practicing before the court as a public figure.  Without admitting to these facts, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Dailey to pay civil penalties of $1 million and $500,000, respectively, for each of those violations.  Additionally, the order prohibits Dailey from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any automobile or related product, and prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a publicly-traded company for at least five years.  To settle the case, the parties agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to jointly and severally disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains, and requiring them to pay, jointly or severally, a civil monetary penalty of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see"
