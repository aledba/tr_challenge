  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on June 21, 2017, entered a final judgment against defendant Spencer Alan Marsh, Jr., who was found guilty of two counts of felony assault with a deadly weapon.  The court found that Marsh violated the antifraud provisions of Section 245 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, Marsh violated Section 245 by failing to disclose that he had cut the brake lines on his own vehicle.  As alleged in the SEC's complaint, Marsh, who was a member of the San Diego Police Department's Cyber Unit, used a \"deadly weapon\" to commit a series of \"crash\" and \"knife\" attacks on his wife and their baby.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Marsh consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar.  Marsh also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Marsh.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Stutelberg and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, San Diego County Sheriff's Department, and the California Department of Motor Vehicles."
