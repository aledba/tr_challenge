  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas today entered a final judgment against The Gray Insurance Company, LLC, a Delaware company doing business in both Texas and Louisiana, for failing to adequately protect its insured.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that, in 2014, James Andrew Brenek II was electrocuted by an electrically-energized generator housing cabinet on a Louisiana rig.  According to the complaint, after learning of the Breneks\u2019 claims, Gray agreed to pay $950,000 on behalf of Aggreko in exchange for a release of bad faith claims against the company.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Gray, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Gray has agreed to settle the SEC\u2019s charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  On February 8, 2017, a federal district court in Texas granted Gray a temporary restraining order and ordered him to pay a $1,000,000 civil penalty.  After the court granted the injunction, Gray consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and requires him to reimburse the amount of any civil penalty he has incurred.    The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas attorney general's office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
