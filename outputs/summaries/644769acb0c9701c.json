  "summary": "The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey today announced that it has entered into a final judgment recognizing Hong Kong-based Manley Toys Limited as a \"collective\" entity under Hong Kong law.  According to the court's order, on March 22, 2016, the Debtor filed for insolvency in Hong Kong.  The court found that, as alleged in the complaint, the liquidators were in control of the liquidation and did not have sufficient funds to pay for the litigation of claims against independent creditors like Aviva.  In its judgment, the court also found that the liquidator and its former principals violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Aviva's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Jersey, alleges that the Court improperly recognized the Hong Kong liquidation as a matter of course, and that the court should consider the merits of the case against Aviva and other independent creditors.  Specifically, the Court ruled that, in a parallel action, Aviva could have been placed on the COI as a result of the Court's finding that Hong Kong was a \"manifestly unfair\" place to place Aviva or independent creditors in liquidation.  It also ruled that Aviva should have had the right to apply for Hong Kong recognition as part of a \"public policy exception\" to the conduct of certain foreign liquidation proceedings.   The Court's judgment, which was entered on May 13, 2020, permanently enjoins Aviva from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders Aviva to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement and prejudgment interest Aviva will pay in the future.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint filed in the United States Court of Appeals, the Honorable Deborah M. Welshhans of the United Kingdom has issued an order appointing a receiver of Hong Kong to determine whether to recognize the liquidated Debtor as a collective entity under U.K. law. The receiver has agreed to the appointment of a committee of inspectors, which will determine the manner in which to proceed with liquidation of a distressed company. The court also granted the Liquidators' request for a temporary restraining order against future violations of Section 15 of the Exchange Act and Rules 15b-20, 13a-1, 13b2-2, and 13b3-3 thereunder, and to appoint a receiver to determine the timing and amount of any civil injunctive relief. The Court also granted Aviva"
