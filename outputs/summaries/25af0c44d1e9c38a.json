  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of a truck driver who was denied his right to return to work following an August 2009 work accident.  The court found that the truck driver had a pre-existing degenerative disc disease, and that he was entitled to temporary total disability (TTD) benefits, penalties and attorney fees.  According to the court's order, filed on March 20, 2018, in connection with a workers' compensation claim brought by Nu Verra Environmental Solutions, a trucking company, the Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department's Department of Labor and Industry Regulation (DOI) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against each of them.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the driver.  On March 24, 2017, the Court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against the defendant and ordered the company to pay a civil penalty of $12,558. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David Peveto, Kelly L. Gibson, and John Ferrell of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General in this matter."
