  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho today entered a final judgment against Shane A. Kraly, a convicted felon who was sentenced to five years in prison for child endangerment, for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of drugs.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boise, Idaho, alleges that, on April 27, 2016, while driving with his mother, M.M., while she was in the throes of a sexual assault and attempted to evade arrest by attempting to evade detection by law enforcement.  According to the complaint, the defendant agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 17a-1 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of five years and a $10,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On May 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action and obtained a temporary restraining order, ordering the return of the defendant's allegedly ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing a $1,500 civil penalty against the other defendants.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of $2,078,098, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties of one year and a half each.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Kelly L. Gibson of the Denver Regional Office, and is being supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Justice's Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Idaho Department of Health and Human Services, and the FBI in this matter."
