  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Pennsylvania yesterday entered a final judgment against the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development (DCDE) for unlawfully withholding documents related to the City of Chester's financial distress.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia on April 25, 2019, the DCDE violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that, in violation of the federal securities laws, the Department of Justice improperly withheld documents relating to certain aspects of the city's recovery plan.  For example, according to the complaint, EConsult Solutions Inc., an independent contractor of the Department, provided legal advice and financial services to the Department in preparing and implementing the Recovery Plan for the City.  Econsult and Fairmount, as well as McNees, were hired by the Department to provide legal advice, financial services, and consulting with state and federal agencies as required by the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, which was filed in the federal district court for the district of Philadelphia, agreed to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins the Department from violating the above-mentioned provisions and orders it to provide an accounting of the withheld records.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has issued an order appointing a consultant to assist the city in its recovery plan, which is subject to approval by the court.  On April 26, 2018, the Court granted the request for an emergency asset freeze and ordered the appointment of an independent consultant to help the city implement its Recovery Plan.  As set forth in the order, the Commission on Audit and Rulemaking has issued a Request for a Restraining Order (RRA) that requires the Commission to determine whether certain documents are subject to disclosure under the federal and state securities laws.  Among other things, the order requires that the Commission determine whether any documents are internal to the agency or, in the alternative, whether they should be withheld from disclosure.  Additionally, the Order requires that all records held by the Commission be shared with the Department and the contractor, and that any records that are withheld must be reviewed by the agency.  Specifically, the court ordered the Commission not to enter into any subcontract for the purposes of implementing, pursuant to Act 47, the City's Recovery Plan, or any research, development, or operation of a municipal project.   The Commission also ordered the Department not to solicit or solicit the assistance of any outside contractor in the purpose of implementing the City Recovery Plan"
