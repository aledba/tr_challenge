The court granted the defendant's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to comply with the court's order.  The court also issued an order suspending the defendant from appearing before the court.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on September 19, 2016, the defendant, H.L. and Jaime G., of Guatemala, told the court that he needed sole custody of their son Matthew because his mother was high on drugs and had abandoned him with a babysitter for three days. The complaint further alleged that Father had been high on methamphetamine when he left the house with the babysitter, and that Mother was \"really high all the time.\"  The complaint alleges that the court improperly imposed a rebuttable presumption against granting custody to a parent who had perpetrated domestic violence.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Father.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Katherine T. Bartlett, John Rymas, and Joseph G. Sansone of the New York Regional Office.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay civil penalties, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty against each of them. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Separately, the SEC filed an amended complaint against Father, alleging that he violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and charging him with violating Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.
