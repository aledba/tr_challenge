  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against Naples Police Department officers Kyle Bradshaw and Ryan Harp for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Naples, Florida, alleges that Bradshaw, who was previously charged with violating the Exchange Act, and Harp violated Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder, by failing to properly review the SEC\u2019s motion for a new trial.  According to the complaint, Bradshaw also failed to disclose to the court that he had been tased by the officers, and that he was standing outside the door when they effectuated the arrest.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants were confronted by an officer who confronted Bradshaw at the door.  Bradshaw allegedly replied, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, that he entered the apartment in order to effectuate an arrest and failed to inform the officer that he needed a warrant to enter the apartment.  He also allegedly told the officer to \"check the record\" before entering the apartment, which he did not do.  As a result of this conduct, the defendants lost their jobs and apartment, and the officers had to resort to resorting to other means of obtaining a search warrant.  Finally, the court denied the Plaintiffs\u2019 request for a temporary restraining order, freezing the officers\u2019 assets, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $150,000.  On May 17, 2012, a federal district court in Atlanta, Georgia, denied the defendants\u2019 requests for a preliminary injunction, ordered Bradshaw to surrender his passport, and ordered Harp to return to the United States and pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  A federal district judge in Birmingham, Alabama, also denied the Defendants\u2019 motion to return their passport.    The case was investigated by the Office of Inspector General and the Florida Office of Professional and Risk Analysis, which conducted a parallel examination of the matter. \u00c2\u00a0The case was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations, and Assistant Director of the Miami Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Amy S. Cotter."
