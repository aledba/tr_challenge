  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment against Uber Technologies, Inc., a now-defunct Massachusetts-based company, for not providing wheelchair accessible vehicles to all areas of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, or at least those currently served by Uber.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston on October 4, 2016, Mr. Theodore and Access with Success, a non-profit corporation, were charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that, in violation of the federal securities laws, Uber violated the mandatory arbitration provision of Section 5 of the Massachusetts General Law, and that, under the federal law, a reasonable person is entitled to a right to participate in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of an automobile.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Uber for its alleged violations of the anti-fraud provisions.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Uber agreed to the entry of an order that permanently enjoins it from violating the above-mentioned provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the matter.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action on August 19, 2019, charging Uber Technologies with violating Section 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17(b)(5) and (c) thereunder, and with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) of\u00c2\u00a0Securities Act and Rule 5d-8 thereunder of the Exchange Act and Rules 5a-11, 13b2-1, 13a-13, 13d-1 and 13d2-11 thereunder in connection with this matter. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Mark Budnitz and Brittany Durgin of the Boston Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by John Shope and Kevin Conroy."
