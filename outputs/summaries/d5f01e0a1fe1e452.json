  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment against Anthony Crespo, a convicted felon who pleaded guilty to violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 5b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that, prior to his release from prison, the defendant reviewed and signed the terms and conditions of his probation, including the approval condition, and thereby manifested his understanding of the necessity to abide by those conditions.  According to the complaint, the court improperly denied the defendant's motion for judicial disqualification on the basis that he had received an anonymous report regarding a sexual assault of a six year old child.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins them from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and (d) of the Exchange Act, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On November 8, 2017, a federal district court in New York entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants, ordering them to return to the court-ordered probation revocation proceedings. The court granted the defendants' request for a preliminary injunction, ordered a conduct-based injunction, and issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the court as part of an ongoing criminal investigation.  A hearing scheduled for Dec. 13, 2018, was scheduled for 11:30 a.m. EST. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Connecticut Office of Inspector General in this matter."
