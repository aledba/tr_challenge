  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of home invasion, attempted aggravated criminal sexual assault, and other related criminal charges.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that defendant William Grant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC alleges that Grant violated Section 17(a)(1) and 17(b)(2)(A)(1)(B) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, and that Grant failed to properly preserve that claim of error for appellate review. The complaint also alleges that the trial court improperly appointed a victim witness advocate to watch Juror B. during the trial, despite the fact that the witness had fallen asleep during the testimony. According to the complaint, the jury deliberated for less than five minutes before deciding to remove the lone African American juror from the jury for cause. The court ultimately found that the jury was not sufficiently situated to consider removing the juror for cause, and therefore Grant was not entitled to a fair trial. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Grant.  In its criminal case against Grant, which is continuing, the SEC charged the defendant with violating the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws, and charged Grant with violating Section 15(a) and (c) of Exchange Act Rule 17b2-1 thereunder and with aiding and abetting the defendant's violations of Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\"). The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, Eric R. Werner, and Glenn S. Gordon of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Werner."
