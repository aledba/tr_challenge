  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in contempt against a defendant for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, from at least 2010 through at least 2016, William V. Martinez, Jr., conducted extensive covert surveillance of his then-wife, D'Anna Welsh, in order to conceal her husband's contemptuous conduct. The court found that, despite depositing his wages into Cristina's bank account, the defendant continued to receive daily reports from the spyware on the plaintiff's computer, and that he made monthly mortgage payments of $7500 and $14,000 for his \u201cdivorce-related obligations.\u201d The court also found that the defendant had no other long-term debt.  In its judgment, the court held Martinez in contempt because he had not proven a financial incapacity to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Martinez consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(5) of The Securities Act, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $2.2 million. The judgment also imposes a $2,220,400.67 civil penalty against Cristina.  On August 2, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action in which it obtained a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order freezing the assets of a third party in violation of the asset standstill order. The SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Martinez, charging him with violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, and with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, Inc.'s (\"Advisers\") Rule 206(3) and (4)-8 thereunder and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by David Baker, Jamie Cook, and Patrick McCluskey of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Baker and Ms. Cook.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Connecticut Office of Financial Regulation in this matter."
