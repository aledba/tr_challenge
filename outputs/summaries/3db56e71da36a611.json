  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against DIRECTV, LLC (\"DIRECTV\") in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint alleges that DIRECTV disclosed the personally identifiable information of approximately 9,116 individuals in violation of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010 (\"STELA\").  According to the complaint, Romero received DIRECTV services from about November 24, 2014, until around April 3, 2017, when he received an email from DIRECTV informing him that it would send him an updated customer agreement.  As alleged, however, Romero did not receive the updated agreement because he did not accept it in writing or electronically.  Instead, the complaint alleges, DIRECTV sent Romero a copy of the 2016 Agreement, which was bound by the terms of the STELA.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Romero consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins DIRECTV from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Romero.  On May 30, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action in which it obtained a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order freezing the assets of DIRECTV and its affiliated companies.  According the SEC complaint, the court's order freezes DIRECTV's assets and orders Romero to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $20,000, which will be offset by the amount of his civil penalty.  Additionally, the Court issued an order requiring DIRECTV to provide an accounting of all of its assets and to pay civil penalties of $100,000 each. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael R. Kasper and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Maryland Office of Financial Regulation, and the Maryland Department of Insurance."
