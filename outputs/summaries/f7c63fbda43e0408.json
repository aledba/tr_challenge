  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered final judgments against General Insurance Company (GEICO) and its insurance subsidiary, GEICO, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in April 2013, Ricardo Perez, a resident of Naples, Florida, made a knowing, oral rejection of coverage under GEICO's automobile policy.  According to the complaint, Perez had a motorcycle policy with GEICO that included UM coverage limits of $10,000 on each of the three insured vehicles, but no UM coverage.

Among other things, the complaint also alleges that the Commission failed to adequately inform the jury of the relevant facts of the case, including: (i) Perez's receipt of a copy of his automobile policy and, at Perez's subsequent request, the creation of an online GEICO account using a unique and secure PIN, and use of the daughter's personal information as answers to two security questions; and (ii) GEICO failed to disclose to the jury that, following the April 2013 phone call, Perez received an email from a GEICO sales representative stating that he did not want UM coverage under the policy; (iii) the written rejection form was not available to the individual insured; (iv) the"
