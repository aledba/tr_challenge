  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of South Carolina today announced criminal charges against a former United States Postal Inspector for his role in a drug conspiracy.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Michael A. Nicholson intercepted packages of methamphetamine in Spartanburg, South Carolina, including one that was destined for someone named Sam Chan at Ath's Residence.  According to the complaint, the FBI contacted Nicholson in March 2014 to investigate a possible drug conspiracy, and Nicholson intercepted a package of methamphetamine from a home located at 199 Black Street. The complaint further alleges that shortly after receiving the package from Nicholson, a California resident who had grown marijuana in California and shipped it to his family members in South Carolina for distribution.  On September 6, 2016, Nicholson intercepted another package containing two pounds of methamphetamine, this time from Sam Chan, who was also a member of the alleged drug ring.  In a parallel action, on September 7, 2017, a federal district court in the District of Columbia found that Ath violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered him to pay a penalty of 151 months in prison.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Ath consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar against him.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David H. Brooks, Kelly L. Gibson, and Amy C. Welshhans of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter. \u00a0The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit, and the Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit."
