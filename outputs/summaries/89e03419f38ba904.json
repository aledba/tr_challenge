  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Clemon D. Parham, Jr., a former Columbus Police Department officer who was convicted and sentenced to 18 years in prison for two separate criminal charges.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, Parham was a concert promoter who convinced his friend, Gregory P. Connal, to invest approximately $100,000 in a concert series to occur over the Memorial Day weekend in 2011.  The complaint alleges that Connal was the victim of a beating perpetrated by Parham.  Connal's girlfriend, Aaliyah Dunson, was a co-defendant of Parham's and Dunson's.  As alleged in the complaint, Connal and Parham lured the victim out of the car and beat him to death with a gun.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Parham arising from the same conduct.  Parham has agreed to settle the charges against him by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $25,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC complaint, however, the defendant has consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and ordering him not to participate in future criminal prosecutions.  On May 2, 2018, the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the defendants' assets.  It also granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations, ordering Parham to pay disgorgement of $2,965, and prejudgment interests of $1,038, and requiring him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Ostrove and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio State Attorney General's Office, and the Ohio Department of Criminal Justice."
