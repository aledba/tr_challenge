  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Heather Burns, a mother of two sons, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 610 of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act.  According to the court's order, on September 27, 2017, Heather filed a motion for a directed finding against August Lifferth, a father-and-son custody agreement for their two sons.  The court found that, based upon its finding of no substantial change in circumstances affecting the children's overall welfare, Heather should retain her status as the parent with primary parental responsibilities and sole decisionmaking responsibilities.  In addition, the court granted Heather's motion for an expedited hearing on August's behalf, which was conducted by Andrew Cores, an attorney at the time of the judgment.  Cores agreed to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in Heather's petition.  He also agreed that, once the court determined that the children had demonstrated a propensity for petty and inappropriate behavior, the parties should be able to schedule individual and/or family counseling for the children; where the children would be exchanged (sometimes in Indiana); holiday parenting time; and any other relief this court deems equitable and just.  On August's motion to dismiss the case against Heather, the judge granted the motion to expedite the hearing and appointed a guardian ad litem (GAL) to represent the parties' interests. The court appointed Cores as the GAL and held a hearing on the motion on October 2, 2018.    In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Indiana today announced criminal charges against Heather. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, charges Heather with violating Section 610, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The complaint also seeks a temporary restraining order, an injunction, and an order requiring Heather to comply with court orders.  A hearing scheduled for October 13, 2018, is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2017."
