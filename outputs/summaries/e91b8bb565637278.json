  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFS) in a parental rights termination case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Antonio, Texas, alleges that, from 2014 to 2018, Father began a long-distance relationship with M.I.A., with whom he raised four biological children. According to the complaint, the DFS sought to terminate Father's parental rights because he had a history of domestic violence and drug use. The complaint also alleges that the Department sought to remove Father from the family home and placed the children in foster homes. The court found that Father violated Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered him to comply with the court's order.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Father, charging him with violating Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 15b2-3 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  On May 23, 2020, the trial court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Father and ordered Father to be enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 16(b)(2)(A) and (c) of Section 13(d) of The Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13d-1 thereunder; and an order appointing a nonparty managing conservator and appointing a permanent director of the agency.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Father consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 15a of the Exchange Act, and orders him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 532 (Tex. App.\u2014San Antonio 2013, no pet).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the San Antonio Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Office of Child and Family Education and the Texas State Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
