  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was convicted of residential burglary and violation of a domestic violence court order.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, alleges that on November 30, 2016, a trial court in Oregon imposed a temporary restraining order on defendant Quran Dayman Ali Ingram. The court found that Ingram had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and imposed a $'60,000 criminal filing fee on him.  According to the complaint, the court did not consider the relevant factors and did not determine whether Ingram was a substantial danger to the community.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the trial court failed to consider the financial issues of the defendant, including his prior failures to appear but no bail jump convictions, and the validity of the foreign protection order is not an element of the offense.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Ingram consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and imposes a $20,000 officer-and-director bar against him. The judgment also prohibits Ingram from participating in any type of criminal proceeding, including serving as an officer or director of a public company, participating in a community college, or participating in an offering of a penny stock, and requires him to provide a copy of the court order to the jury.  On December 2, 2018, a federal district court in Washington, D.C., entered an order requiring Ingram to post a secured or unsecured bond in both the felony and misdemeanor judgments and sentences. The order also requires Ingram to show that he has had a prior felony conviction and that he had a history of escape and failure to appear in court. The judge deferred this decision to the next trial court, which was not required by the court to determine whether to impose the $'200 bail. The trial court also did not require Ingram to provide an attorney. The complaint charges Ingram with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"). The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The SEC also seeks a conduct-based injunction against future violations of the securities laws and an officer and director bar against Ingram from appearing or practicing before the SEC as a public figure. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against Ingram."
