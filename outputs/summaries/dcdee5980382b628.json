  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who, while representing himself, was removed from the courtroom for misconduct during a jury trial.  The court found that, in exercising the right to self-representation at trial, defendant made a knowing and voluntary choice to leave the courtroom and leave the defense table empty and the trial court to determine whether to proceed with the trial in his absence.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in New York, defendants were warned that, if he engaged in misconduct during jury selection, he would be removed from appearing and appearing before the court for the remainder of the trial day.  As alleged in the order, the defendant did not consent to the removal of his right to representation and, instead, engaged in disruptive conduct throughout the trial and, before closing argument, refused to participate or be present during the trial as required by the court order.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against defendant, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $10,000.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 597 (2014).  The SEC's Complaint against the defendant in this matter, which was filed in the U. S. District Judge's Office in Manhattan, charges defendants with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar against defendants who violate the securities laws. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, a conduct-based injunction prohibiting defendants from acting as unregistered brokers, and the appointment of a trial judge. The court also issued an order suspending the defendant from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney in the event of a finding of misconduct by the SEC.  On May 9, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, and other emergency relief. The case was handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Gibson."
