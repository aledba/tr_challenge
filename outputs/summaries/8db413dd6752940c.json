  "summary": "On June 26, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against the City of Harrisburg, Pa., in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.  The court found that the City violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also found that, contrary to the stated intent of the city, the city violated the First Amendment by failing to adequately enforce certain of the provisions of the federal anti-fraud laws.  According to the court's order, the City also failed to adequately consider the safety and effectiveness of the buffer zones.  In a parallel action, on March 24, 2016, the court granted the City's request for a preliminary injunction against the imposition of a civil injunction and ordered the city to provide an accounting of the number of people who had been called to the clinic.  Without admitting or denying the city's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the First and Second Amendments, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $2,500, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000. The final judgment also prohibits the City from imposing a penny stock bar on anyone selling or offering an investment in a public company, and from imposing an officer-and-director bar on any individual selling or selling any company offering or offering any investment in any public company.  On March 26, 2018, the Court issued a temporary restraining order and issued an order temporarily freezing the assets of the City and prohibiting them from issuing or selling the securities of any publicly-traded company. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, charges the City with violating the federal securities laws and seeks permanent injunctions, civil money penalties, and an injunction against future violations of the securities laws. The complaint also seeks preliminary injunctions against further violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as an order requiring the City to comply with Rule 12(b)(5) and Rule 12b-7 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction against further violation of Section 15(a)(2) of Exchange Act Section 10-b) and Rules 15a-1, 13a-11, and 13b-13 thereunder; and an order ordering the issuance of an order permanently enjoining the city from violating these provisions"
