  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation against Dean Fitzpatrick, a former correctional officer who was found permanently disabled.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Sacramento, Florida, Fitzpatrick was injured in a work-related injury that caused impairment in earning capacity and impairment in the normal use of a member or a handicap in the open labor market.  The complaint alleges that Fitzpatrick was permanently and totally disabled when he sustained the injury.  As alleged in the complaint, Fitzpatrick suffered permanent total disability and permanent partial disability when he was evaluated by a physician using a diagnostic tool called the additive method to combine multiple disability values.  In addition, the complaint alleges, as a result of Fitzpatrick's injury, he was unable to return to work as a full-time employee, despite repeated requests to do so.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Fitzpatrick agreed to a judgment that permanently restrains him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his or her ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  To settle the case, Fitzpatrick consented to the entry of the final judgment, which, in a parallel action, permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,038,078, which is equal to his pre-judgment interest and a penalty of $100,000.  He also agreed to be enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any final judgment.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Peter Chang-Sing and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the California Office of Inspector General in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
