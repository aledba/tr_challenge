  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Michigan-based auto mechanic who was found not disabled by a federal judge.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Gregory C. Ghanim, a former auto mechanic, and his employer, Tommasetti, M.D., violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to provide sufficient evidence to support his claims that he was not disabled.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, contrary to the SEC's findings, Dr. Gandler's opinion was not supported by the evidence in the record, and that Plaintiff was unable to perform any of the tasks required by the SEC.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the SEC has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins the defendants from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On August 24, 2018, Judge Marsh granted a motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered a temporary restraining order, and issued an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue an order imposing an injunction, imposing a $75,000 civil penalty and imposing an $80,000 officer- and director bar, and ordering the receiver to provide a copy of the complaint to the receiver.  A hearing scheduled for September 30, 2018 was scheduled for 6:30 p.m. EST.  Judge Marsh also granted a request for an emergency restraining order and ordered a hearing on August 31, 2018 to determine the appropriate amount of money to be spent on the receiver's home and on other emergency relief. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can\u00c2\u00a0check the background\u00c2\u00a0of people selling investments using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a separate case, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan today announced criminal charges against Ghanem.   The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, Eric R. Werner, and Patrick J. McCluskey of the SEC"
