  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against the agency that issued a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Montana, alleges that the agency violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the agency's 2014 finding that the arctic grayling was in danger of extinction was arbitrary and capricious because it relied on unsupported population growth to determine whether it was a threat.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in rejecting the 2014 finding, FWS failed to adequately consider the threat posed by the declining number of arctic greyling in the Big Hole River.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to the final judgment that permanently enjoins the agency from violating the federal law and orders it to issue an order permanently enjoining it from violating these provisions. The final judgment also orders the agency to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a $1,000 civil penalty for each of the defendants.  Finally, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the agency against the defendants in a related administrative proceeding, ordering the SEC to conduct an independent review of its 2014 finding. The SEC is continuing its investigation of the matter. The litigation will be led by John Rymas and supervised by Amy Gwiazda.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Montana Department of Fish and Wildlife. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
