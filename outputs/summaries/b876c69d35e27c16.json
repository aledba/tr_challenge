  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against a Texas attorney who claimed to be the rightful owner of a property in Brazos County, Texas.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Billy Hines, a defendant in the Property Suit, claimed that he was entitled to attorney immunity because he prepared documents ancillary to the divorce decree that allegedly shifted the tax burden to the other spouse.  The complaint alleges that Youngkin, who was not present at trial, signed a settlement agreement in which he would convey his undivided interest in the contested property with no intention of complying with their own obligations under the agreement.  Hines also claimed that the Scotts and Capps then deeded their interest in a 45-acre subsection to Curtis Capps, a client of Youngkin's, as \"trustee.\"  Youngkin also allegedly claimed that Capps personally owned the portion of the 45 acre subsection that he had not transferred to Hines.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Youngkin consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay $17,290 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a $1,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Youngkin arising from the same conduct alleged in the Complaint.   The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint charges Youngkin with violating the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and officer-and-director and penny stock bars.
