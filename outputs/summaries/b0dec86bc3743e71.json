  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment against Square Properties, LLC, a New Jersey-based real estate developer, in a related administrative proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Jersey, alleges that Square Properties violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Square Properties and its consultant, Princeton Hydro, misrepresented to the SEC that the GSR-32 methodology was appropriate for the site because of the presence of wetlands.  In addition, the complaint alleges Square Properties failed to account for off-site runoff and failed to adequately assess the impact on the site's water quality, recharge, and volume control capabilities.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Square has consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Square has also agreed to a $50,000 civil penalty.  Finally, Square agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any municipal bonds, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by the Office of Inspector General's Analysis and Detection Center, with the assistance of the Division of Environmental Quality's Office of Risk Analysis and Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Brooks and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Department of Natural Resources, and the Federal Office of Environmental Education and Advocacy."
