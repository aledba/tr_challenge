  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Davion L. Jefferson in a Hobbs Act robbery case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, Jefferson, a convicted felon, used a series of false statements to convince a jury that he was capable of securing a fair trial.  The SEC alleges that, contrary to Jefferson\u2019s claims, the jury was not told that a gun was a threat to a person or property.  Instead, the complaint alleges that Jefferson used a combination of lies and deceit to convince the jury that a BB gun was not a threat and that he did not have the capacity to prove that he had a gun.  As alleged in the complaint, Jefferson also falsely told a witness that one of the BB guns had a silver ring at the end of its barrel.  He also allegedly told the witness that the BB gun had a \"smooth sound and a high pitched click\" when cocked.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Jefferson, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting the conduct of other defendants in these robberies.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Jefferson also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar, with the right to reapply as a judge upon motion of the court upon his motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the charged sections of the securities laws.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17, Criminal Code Bulletin No. 13-20, Criminal Justice Release No-13-20.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Jefferson and a criminal case against Lolar, alleging that he violated Section 924(c)(3) and Rule 9a-1 thereunder.
