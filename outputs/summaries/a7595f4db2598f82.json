  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Maryland today entered a final judgment against a Baltimore man convicted of possession of and with intent to distribute a controlled substance.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Maryland, alleges that, in May 2014, a Maryland man was arrested and charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that the defendant, Erik Stoddard, was the only adult supervising Calen DiRubbo when he was arrested. According to the complaint, Young allegedly provided the defendant with false prescriptions for a drug that he believed he had obtained from an authorized provider, and falsely claimed that his wife had valid prescriptions for the drug. In reality, the complaint alleges, the prescriptions were non-existent and could not be admitted as hearsay because they were not admissible as part of a statutory defense. The SEC also alleges that Young failed to adequately disclose to the court that he received the prescriptions from a physician who prescribed them, and failed to disclose that he had signed the prescriptions himself.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for Maryland today announced criminal charges against Young. In a related case, the Court of Special Appeals today issued a temporary restraining order, freezing Young's assets, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $1,500. The court also issued an order suspending Young from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Young has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposes a $25,000 civil penalty against him. The settlement is subject to court approval. The case is being handled by Joseph M. McLaughlin and Margaret A. Berger of the SEC Enforcement Division's Baltimore Regional Office. The litigation will be led by John Henry Wigmore and supervised by Jennifer A. Birkenheier.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Maryland Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Maryland Office of Financial Regulation."
