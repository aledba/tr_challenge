  "summary": "On March 10, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment in favor of the Zoning Commission's motion for an asset freeze and other emergency relief.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbia, South Carolina, alleges that the Commission failed to adequately consider the potential impact of gentrification, land values destabilization, and housing affordability on the neighborhood.  According to the complaint, the Commission's decision to approve the PUD violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206 of 1940.  In its final judgment, the court found that the commission failed adequately to consider the impact of the project on neighborhood land values and the availability of adequate, affordable housing in the community.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000, and bars them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any real estate in the District. The final judgment also prohibits the Commission from imposing a penny stock bar on anyone selling or offering to sell a real estate investment for less than $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-17(a).  The Commission's Final Judgment, which was entered on September 19, 2016, also ordered the Commission to conduct a thorough and thoughtful review of the proposed PUD. The Commission also issued an order requiring the applicant to provide a copy of its final report to the Commission, which recommended that it consider the merits of the application, including that the proposed building be set back four feet from the property line and that the amount of available space be determined by the District's Office of Planning (OOP) and Department of Transportation (D.C. Department of Housing and Community Development) as well as that the OOP consider the relative value of the property and its potential impacts on the quality of the city services and facilities. The SEC also ordered that the applicant \"consider [a] deeper affordability proffer\" that includes a provision in leases precluding residents from securing a residential parking permit, that requires the building to be raised to 50% or 80% of the area median income, and that there is \"very limited parking\" in the area.  On September 29, 2016 the Commission issued its final opinion, ordering the application"
