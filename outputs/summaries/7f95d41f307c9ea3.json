  "summary": "On February 28, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of the Social Security Administration (SSA) against Loraine N. Hayden.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Buffalo, New York, alleges that, on May 2, 2012, the SSA issued an opinion finding that Plaintiff suffered from major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, borderline personality disorder, PTSD, and generalized anxiety disorder.  According to the complaint, Dr. Shamsi's opinion, which was not supported by substantial evidence in the record, caused Plaintiff to miss approximately two days of work per month.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Plaintiff had a \"noted increase\" in pain with increased stress and/or a significant increase in her symptoms when experiencing stressful situations.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, the Commission of Social Security issued its final judgment on March 27, 2017, denying Plaintiff's application for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income.  As set forth in the Commission's final judgment, the SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On March 28, 2019, the Court granted the SEC and SSA's request for a temporary restraining order against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue a civil injunctive relief order against the Commission.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5:15-cv-00688 (Dkt. 9 at 2).  The Commission's order also requires the SEC to provide a copy of the final judgment to the Commission, which is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael R. Halloran and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Office of the United States Secretary of State."
