  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi today entered a final order approving a Certificate of Need for Wound Care Management, LLC d/b/a MedCentris for the \u201c[p]rovision of [d]igital [s]ubtraction [a]ngiography services (Limb Salvage Program).\u201d  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Mississippi Code Section 41-7-201(2) provides for the right to petition the court for review of a certificate of need for any health care facility.  The complaint alleges that, in 2016, the Mississippi Department of Health issued an order requiring that a final judgment be entered within 120 days.  According to the complaint, this order violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Mississippi today announced criminal charges against River Region, a Vicksburg, Mississippi hospital, and its owner.  On September 17, 2019, the Honorable Janet M. McMurtry of the Mississippi Court of Appeals granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered River Region to prepare an application for an emergency court order. The court granted River Region's request, without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, for a preliminary injunction and a hearing to determine whether to proceed with the litigation. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Mississippi Office of Inspector General in this matter.  For further information, see Press Release No. 5, 2018."
