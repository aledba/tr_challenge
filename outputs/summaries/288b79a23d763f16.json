  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against Pioneer Insurance Company, Inc., a Michigan-based insurance company, and its owner, Dana Reynard Harris, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Warren, Michigan, on September 13, 2013, Harris and State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm) filed a claim for personal protection insurance (PIP) benefits from Pioneer through the policy issued to Wright. The complaint alleges that, as a result of the delay, Harris was unable to recover most of his PIP benefits from any other insurer because he was a resident relative in the home of Wright at the time of the accident.  The complaint further alleges that the trial court improperly applied the doctrine of laches to the claims of other insurance companies, including Mendelson Orthopedics, PC (Mendelson), and Synergy Spine and Orthopedic Surgery Center, LLC (Synergy) (collectively, defendants).  The SEC's Complaint against Pioneer, filed on December 14, 2017, in the United States District Court in Michigan, charges Harris, State Farm, and Mendelson with violating the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Harris.  Among other things, the SEC is seeking a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an injunction against future violations of the antiligence provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4), of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder, as well as an officer-and-director bar against Harris from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any PIP policy.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Harris consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating these provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov."
