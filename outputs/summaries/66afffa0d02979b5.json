  "summary": "The Texas Department of Education today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action in federal court against the Texas Education Agency (TEA) and its Commissioner for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 12.128 of the Education Code.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, alleges that Texas violated the federal securities laws by failing to recognize the value of property purchased with state funds after September 1, 2001.  According to the complaint, TEA failed to recognize that state funds were being used to acquire property for school purposes, including to make mortgage payments on the properties.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against TEA for its role in this matter.  TEA has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the securities laws, and orders it to pay disgorgement of $144,060.45, prejudgment interest of $7.5 million, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the Commission has also agreed to pay a $75,000 civil penalty and to the appointment of a conservator to oversee the property purchase and disposition of the properties in violation of the charged provisions of the state securities laws.  To settle the case, the SEC agreed to a permanent injunction and to a temporary restraining order prohibiting the Commission from issuing or selling any security or other security-related documents to the public.  Finally, the court granted the Commission the right to determine the amount of money that should be spent on acquiring and maintaining a charter school property, and to determine whether to grant or revoke the Commission's authority to acquire and maintain the school property.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Office of Education and Inspections and Examinations. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to use this information to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and to identify whether their investments are subject to SEC scrutiny."
