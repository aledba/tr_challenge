  "summary": "On June 4, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas entered a final judgment in favor of the Arkansas Secretary of State's Office in its ongoing litigation against the state's new political party ballot access requirements.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas, alleges that, from at least January through June 2019, Arkansas passed a ballot access rule that required new political parties to collect at least 10,000 signatures in order to qualify for the November 2020 general election.  According to the complaint, the new state law required new parties to qualify to participate in the ballot access process.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the new Arkansas law imposed a three-percent retention requirement on independent candidates.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal on June 5, 2019 and unsealed on June 6, 2020, the Arkansas secretary of state's office issued an order imposing the three percent retention requirement and requiring the registration of new parties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint filed in the federal district court for the Southern District of New York, the SEC alleges that Arkansas violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  On June 8, 2019 the court entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws.  To determine whether the defendants are entitled to permanent injunctions, the court ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar against each of them.   The court's order also ordered the parties to provide an accounting of the amount of signatures collected by the parties, which is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael Kroupa, Ricky Harrington, Jr., Christopher Olson, and Michael Kalagias of the SEC Enforcement Division's Fort Smith Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Ms. Richter, Michael Pakko, and Ricky Harrington and supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the Atlanta Regional Office, with the assistance of John Rymas of the Public Finance Abuse Unit."
