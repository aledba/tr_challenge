  "summary": "On May 27, 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against California State University, Los Angeles (CSU) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, Sungho Park was hired by CSU in 2007 as an Assistant Professor in the Charter College of Education, Division of Special Education and Counseling, to provide services to members of a sheriffs' association under a prepaid legal services plan.  As alleged in the complaint, Park was not credited with having published two papers when he actually published four.  The complaint further alleges that at least three Caucasian faculty members in his division received tenure with \"a publication record similar to or inferior to his.\"  The SEC alleges that Park failed to meet its burden on the first step of the anti-SLAPP analysis, and that he was not given credit for other professional activities that should have counted toward his professional achievement rating.  In addition, the complaint alleges that CSU's decision not to renew DeCambre's contract in May 2013 was based on \"misstatements\" made to Park during the peer review process.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, CSU consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  On May 31, the SEC filed a complaint against CSU, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and an officer and director bar against Park.  To settle the case, the court entered a temporary restraining order against Park and ordered him to return to CSU with a copy of the complaint that was filed in the SEC on May 24, 2014. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Los Angeles Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau. The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau and Ms. Tuszynska. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
