The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Lucas County, Ohio, alleges that, on July 26, 2016, appellee CIG Toledo, LLC filed a landlord's complaint for eviction, breach of the lease, and unjust enrichment against its co-defendants, Naqid Hasan, Yazeed Qaimari, and Mona Qaimar.  According to the complaint, the defendants agreed to settle the matter by agreeing to pay $16,866 in attorney's fees and costs, plus $6,025 in civil penalties, in the amount of $21,921.13.  Appellee also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest thereon, as well as civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against each of the defendants.  On October 21, the court granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order appointing a receiver to oversee the eviction proceedings.  A hearing on October 24, 2017 was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Eastern time.  An SEC hearing on September 21, 2016 was conducted in the absence of a court order requiring the defendants to comply with the court's order, and a hearing was scheduled on October 25, 2016 to determine whether or not to proceed with the enforcement action under the lease.   The court also granted the parties' motion for a preliminary injunction, which prohibits them from imposing any monetary or non-monetary penalty, and ordered the parties to pay civil penalties and other relief at a later date.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (July 26, 2015).  The complaint also alleges that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of\u00c2\u00a0The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to provide sufficient information to the court as to the reasonable and appropriate award of attorney fees.  Additionally, the complaint alleges the defendants failed to provide any reasonable explanation for why the court did not consider the reasonable fees to be included in the settlement"
