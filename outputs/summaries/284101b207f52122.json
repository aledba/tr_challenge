  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment in contempt of court against Ann Rutledge, a former legal secretary at SkyWest Airlines, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 401(3) of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., on November 5, 1996, Rutledge agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains her from violating the charged provisions.  The court also found that Rutledge violated the pre-judgment provision of the contempt order, which requires a court to determine whether a defendant has committed a serious obstruction of justice.  Rutledge also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of a contempt order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Ms. Rutledge consented to the judgment, which permanently enjoins her from future violations and orders her to return to the United States and pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of her disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Rutledge.  On November 6, 2016, the court issued an order suspending Rutledge from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering her to comply with the court's order suspending her from appearing, practicing, or participating in any proceeding in violation of the court\u2019s orders.   The SEC complaint charges Rutledge with violating Sections 401(1) and 401(2) and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgements of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interests, and a civil monetary penalty.  For further information see Litigation Release No. 13-cv-01-17. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, under the supervision of Assistant Chief of the Division of Criminal Justice. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Justice Criminal Division in this matter."
