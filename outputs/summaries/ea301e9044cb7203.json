  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington yesterday entered a final judgment against the City of Seattle and its contractor, Fuller Style and Steady Floats, in a land use case.  The court found that the City violated the federal securities laws by failing to enforce certain of its land use orders.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Seattle, Seattle, Washington, the city violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the city failed to meet its obligations under Section 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(c) and 14(a)(3)(B).  The complaint further alleges that, contrary to the city\u2019s representations, the SMA and the City did not err in its interpretation of the law when determining whether the replacement FOWRs constituted substantial development under the SMP.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin the city from violating the above-mentioned provisions and order the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 12-008, 2013 WL 1294431, July 13, 2013. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
