  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Aleksandr Kogan, a data scientist who developed the app that enabled the firm Cambridge Analytica to collect personal details about millions of Facebook users.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Kogan.  According to the court's order, filed on March 21, 2019, Kogan filed a complaint in federal court in New York City alleging that, in March 2018, he failed to timely respond to a summons and complaint filed by his then-counsel, Paul Grewal, Alex Stamos, and Mark Zuckerberg.  Kogan's complaint alleged that, on March 15, 2018, Grewals and Stamos had agreed to waive service of the complaint, which Kogan did not do, and that Kogan failed to comply with Rule 4(d) of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced parallel criminal charges against the defendants.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Jennifer Anne Beckage, Esq., of the New York Regional Office, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.
