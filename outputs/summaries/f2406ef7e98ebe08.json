  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against mother, who was found liable for her wrongful termination of parental rights based on her failure to communicate with or provide financial support for her daughters.  The court found that mother had abandoned her daughters, H.D., who was born in 2009 and is now nine years old, because she was unable to provide support for the girls while she was in treatment for substance abuse.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in New York, mother sought to regain custody of her daughters by convincing her ex-husband to relinquish custody of the girls.  As alleged in the court order, however, mother did not relinquish her parental rights until she was well enough to return to family court to seek a permanent injunction.  Instead, the court found mother to have violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered her to pay $1,000 in child support, which is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the court\u2019s findings, mother consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 7822 of the Exchange Act, and orders her to repay the amount of her ill-gotten gains with interest in a future settlement.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against mother.   The SEC also announced related charges against her husband, who has been sentenced to prison for his role in a scheme to steal from his wife and daughter, and her mother for her role in the scheme.  To learn more about child custody decisions, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  Investors can also check the background of anyone selling investments by using the SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify any red flags of suspicious activity.  For example, the SEC previously issued an investor alert warning investors to be aware of potential conflicts of interest when making investment decisions based on whether to invest in an investment in a real estate development project.  Investor.gov has also issued an\u00c2\u00a0investigational alert\u00c2\u00a0on the dangers of investment fraud.\u00c2\u00a0In a separate case, the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania today announced parallel criminal charges."
