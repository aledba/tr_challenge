  "summary": "On February 7, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the estate of Clayton L. Traver, who died on March 20, 2019.  The court granted the estate's request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order against Traver and his company, ManorCare Health Services, LLC.  According to the court's order, Traver signed an Admission Agreement and an Arbitration Agreement on behalf of Decedent, who resided in several different nursing home facilities on multiple occasions, including three separate residencies at the ManorCare Facility.  Traver claimed that, in an effort to maximize profits, he intentionally reduced staffing levels and increased the number of sick, elderly, and frail patients requiring complex medical care.  He also claimed that he signed the arbitration agreement on his wife's behalf.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced that it filed an emergency action to freeze the assets of ManorCare and Traver's company, HCR ManorCare, Inc.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges Traver with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and injunctive relief.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the estate has consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordering the estate to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $10,000. \u00c2\u00a0The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2019.  On May 12, 2016, the court issued an order freezing the assets held by the estate, barring them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty.
