  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a civil injunctive action brought by a consumer in violation of the anti-SLAPP provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia on November 5, 2009, filed by Laura Nunez, a California resident, alleging that she received a cease-and-desist letter from a California-based company claiming that it was liable for violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint further alleges that the complaint was filed on behalf of a member of a homeowners association who was also named in the complaint as a defendant.  As alleged, the complaint alleges that, as a result of the complaint, the plaintiff could not demonstrate a probability of prevailing on its declaratory relief claim.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of these provisions, orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties of $104,293.75 and $57,765.63, respectively, for each of the defendants' alleged violations of those provisions.  Additionally, the court granted the parties' motion for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the defendants from further violating the charged provisions, and granted the defendants the right to a preliminary injunction against further violations.  On November 6, 2010, a federal district court in Los Angeles entered a judgment against the defendant, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and ordering the company to pay an $80,000 civil penalty in the amount of $75,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Gotterba of the Los Angeles Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
