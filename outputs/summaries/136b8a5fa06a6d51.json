(\"Atrium\") and John Sipala, LLC (\"Sipala\").  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on September 5, 2017 in federal district court in New York City, defendants Peter Dejana, William F. Wynperle, Jr. (\"Dejana\"), and Michael Brewley (\"Brewley\") violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that defendants violated the fiduciary duty provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule\u00c2\u00a05(b) and (c) thereunder, and that defendants breached their duty to the court to determine reasonable fees and costs.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and ordering disgorgement of $1,080,000 plus prejudgment interest of $320,000.
