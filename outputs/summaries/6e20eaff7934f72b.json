  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants-appellants' motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing their assets, and ordering them to pay $470,727.57 in fees and costs in the wake of a court-ordered consent decree.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Connecticut, alleges that the District Court improperly awarded attorneys' fees to defendants who had failed to substantially comply with a consent decree issued by the federal government in March 2002.  According to the complaint, the court found that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the court improperly awarded fees based on the defendants\u2019 failure to comply with the agreement.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Defendants-Appellants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and from participating in any future issuance of a civil injunctive relief order.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants for their roles in violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $675,000 they received, plus a civil penalty of $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval, and the court will determine whether to impose a permanent injunction. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Connecticut Office of Inspector General in this matter."
