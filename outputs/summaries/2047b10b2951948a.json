  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Oregon today announced criminal charges against a Salem man accused of fatally stabbing his brother.  According to the SEC's complaint, on July 3, 2014, Salem police officers arrested and took him into an interview room to question him about a documentary that he had recently seen. The complaint alleges that defendant invoked his right to remain silent when he told Tallan that he didn't want to talk to the officers and that he would prefer to get the DNA swab directly from him.  The complaint further alleges that, after he invoked his constitutional right to be silent, the officers reinitiated questioning following a second smoke break.  As alleged in the complaint, defendant paused briefly, then gave defendant two generalized reminders of the Miranda rights that defendant had invoked earlier.  Tallan, who ultimately conducted the challenged interviews, provided defendant with a copy of the recorded interview, which he read from a card.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins the officers from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the officers to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay civil penalties of $10,000 each, and imposing officer- and director-level injunctions against further violations of Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, ordering Tallan to comply with the court's order, and ordering him to pay a $20,000 civil penalty.  On the same day, the court granted the officers' request for a temporary restraining order against Tallan and ordered him to return to the interview room after two days of deliberation.  To learn more about the Miranda provisions of Sections 13(a), 13(c) and 13(d)(2) of The Securities Act, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (2014).  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by David Avila-Nava and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Oregon State Attorney General's Office, and the FBI's Office of Criminal Investigations."
