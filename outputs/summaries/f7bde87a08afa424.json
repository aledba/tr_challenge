  "summary": "On May 13, 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a temporary restraining order against a California woman accused of soliciting for the sale of her son's body.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that A.W. had taken M.M. with her when she went to solicit sex and then, while incarcerated on charges of prostitution, failed to make an appropriate plan for his ongoing care and supervision.  According to the complaint, the defendant had left her son in the care of her pimp, Keven L., when she was arrested for the same conduct.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants had been in a relationship for approximately one year and had been helping her raise her son while in the custody of the Department of Children and Family Services (DHS).  The complaint alleges that, while in custody, A. W. had been arrested for prostitution on May 7, 2014 and left her husband and child with his pimp while she was incarcerated on those same charges.  In a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the Defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000, and ordering the Defendants to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  A hearing scheduled for June 4, 2014 was scheduled for 5:30 p.m. The Commission's order, which is subject to court approval, requires that the defendants be present at the court's jurisdiction/disposition hearing to determine whether to proceed immediately with a disposition order or otherwise impose a penalty of $150,000.  On June 5, 2014 the Commission issued an order suspending the defendants' access to the internet, including the ability to access the internet without a lawyer, and requiring them to provide an account of their alleged conduct in the presence of a judge or a court-appointed receiver of a court order.   The Commission also issued a subpoena for a copy of the subpoena, which was obtained by the Commission on the Status of a Child and a Request for an Investigation by the Office of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Division of Criminal Justice. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's investigation was conducted by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Los Angeles Regional Office."
