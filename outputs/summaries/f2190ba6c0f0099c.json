  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island today entered a final judgment against Kevin Hunt in a receivership case brought by the Family Court.  The court entered a judgment on June 27, 2006 ordering the permanent receiver to distribute the proceeds from the sale of 25 Burnside Avenue in Narragansett in accordance with the receiver's recommendations.  According to the court's order, Kevin and his wife, Alice Hunt, owned the property as tenants by the entirety and lived there together with their daughter, Allie.  Kevin and Allie filed a petition for receivership on May 25, 2016, in which they agreed that the property should be distributed as a marital asset as set forth in the marital settlement agreement.  In its order, the court ordered the receiver to allocate the proceeds to Kevin's share of the net proceeds, which was to be distributed equally between Kevin and the receiver.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the receiver did not err in crediting the receivership estate the sum of $38,250 for the fair market value of the property, nor did Kevin sign the 2006 mortgage deed, nor was he required to make any mortgage payments.  Instead, Kevin alleges that the receiver misappropriated the entire balance of an outstanding mortgage from the property and charged the receiver with misappropriating the balance of the mortgage.    The Court also ordered Kevin to pay rent retroactively to the receiver, which he agreed to do.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Kevin has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay $577,500 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $192,500.  Allie has also agreed to the appointment of a permanent receiver, who will determine the amount of the proceeds distributed equally among the parties.  On May 24, 2017, the Court granted the receiver a temporary restraining order against Kevin and ordered him to vacate the property at a later date.  A hearing on May 26, 2017 was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. that same day to consider whether Kevin should be held in contempt of court, and a hearing on June 7, 2016 for a preliminary injunction against Kevin.  To settle the matter, Kevin agreed to a $2.5 million civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, with the right to reapply after five years.
