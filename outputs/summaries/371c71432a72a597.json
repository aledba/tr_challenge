  "summary": "On June 9, 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a final judgment in favor of a criminal-defense attorney who was convicted of forging a client's will.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in Texas, Patricia Skelton was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court found that, under Peeler, a convicted criminal can not sue his or her defense attorney for legal malpractice unless he or she has been exonerated on direct appeal, through post-conviction relief, or otherwise vacates a conviction.  The court also ruled that, until the conviction is overturned, a defendant cannot sue his/her attorney for a malpractice claim until she is actually innocent of the underlying crime.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action in the case.

The judgment also imposes a two-year statute of limitations, which requires defendants to prove their innocence in a court-ordered proceeding before proceeding with a judgment against them.  For example, the court of appeals previously ruled that a defendant could not sue a criminal defense attorney based on a finding of non-adherence to the pre-judgmental nature of a conviction, and that a jury could not determine whether a defendant was innocent until proven guilty in a criminal case.  On the same day that the SEC issued its order, a federal district court in New York issued an order requiring defendants to submit a written and oral history to a jury that would determine whether to grant or reject their claims for a second time.  Among other things, the order required defendants to provide proof of their innocence before the jury would consider whether to proceed with their claims.  Finally, the"
