  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against a defendant and her husband in a second-degree manslaughter case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Portland, Oregon, on May 9, 2017, defendant and husband, Thomas Goby, agreed to settle the SEC\u2019s charges by agreeing to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC alleges that the defendants failed to disclose to the trial court that, in the hours leading up to her death, she was uncommunicative and so weak that she could not walk to the bathroom on her own.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, while in the bathroom, she fell and was vomiting and \"peed everything she *** drank\" when she did try to speak.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants were reckless and negligent in failing to seek medical care for S, despite knowing that she was suffering from diabetic ketoacidosis and that she had no reason to believe that the patient had a serious medical emergency.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay a civil penalty of 120 months, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000, which is equal to the civil penalty imposed by the court on each defendant.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants the right to request a temporary restraining order and to appoint a receiver for the receiver of the receiver.  On May 10, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendants, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the sale or issuance of any security deposit in the brokerage account of a penny stock company.
