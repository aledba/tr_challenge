  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, in 2012, the court granted a motion to modify a defendant's alimony and child support order, which the court found to be improper because the defendant had failed to comply with the court's orders to modify the defendants' alimony obligations. The court also found that the defendant was at risk for recurrent cellulitis, which is a potentially life threatening condition. The complaint further alleges that the court improperly granted the defendant's request to modify, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, for a total of $1.6 million.  In a parallel action, on May 3, 2016, the United States District Court in Manhattan entered a judgment against the defendant, ordering him to pay $'4680 in attorney's fees and costs in the amount of $'41,016. The judgment also ordered the defendant to pay a civil penalty of $\u20191,000, and ordered the court to determine whether to grant the defendant a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal anti-fraud provisions.  On May 4, 2017, a federal district court in Brooklyn, New York entered an order granting the defendant the right to modify his alimony, child support, and other pre-judgment relief. The order also imposed a five-year bar on the defendant.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal on May 2, 2016 and unsealed yesterday, the defendants agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest thereon, and to pay civil penalties thereon. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Justice in this matter.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
