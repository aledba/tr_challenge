  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Hampshire today announced criminal charges against a New Hampshire woman accused of making a materially false statement to a federal agency in connection with her work as an independent contractor for the New Hampshire Institute of Agriculture and Forestry.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Hampshire, alleges that Suzanne Brown was unlawfully barred from appearing or practicing before a federal district court as a result of her conviction for making a material false statement.  According to the complaint, Brown was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Brown agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains her convictions and orders her to pay a penalty equal to the amount of money that Moran and Yowell had been paid for the work that they had performed for the NHIAF. Brown also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Connecticut today entered final judgments against Brown, finding her guilty on all of the counts, ordering her to be permanently enjoined from appearing, practicing, or appearing before the court as an attorney, and ordering Brown to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Brown has consented to a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, other than for the purpose of obtaining a temporary restraining order.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge of the United Kingdom granted Brown's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations, and ordered her to comply with the court's orders.  To settle the case, Brown will be required to show cause and effect the issuance of a judgment that imposes permanent injunctions, a conduct-based injunction, and a penalty of $1,000,000.   Brown also has agreed to a hearing in which she will have the opportunity to respond to the jury's recommendation on whether to impose a civil injunctive action against her, and to pay an officer and director bar, in a hearing that is subject to approval by the court upon motion of the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 534 F.3d 1, 18 (1st Cir. 2016).  Brown has also agreed not to participate in any disciplinary proceeding related to her convictions, and will be prohibited from appearing and practicing before the SEC as a judge."
