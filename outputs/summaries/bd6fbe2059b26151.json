  "summary": "On June 11, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Henry P. Flanagan, Jr., a Louisiana resident, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, Henry and Susan L. Pittman were divorced on October 3, 2003, and agreed to pay child support for their three children by consent agreement. The complaint alleges that Henry failed to disclose to Susan that he had hired a financial expert until a hearing officer conference was held on March 13, 2018 and that he immediately sent documents to Mr. Singleton to review.  The complaint further alleges that after learning that the financial expert was not permitted to testify, Henry continued to cross-examine Ms. Brown, despite being told by the trial court that he only had fifteen minutes of his time remaining.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Henry.  On June 13, 2017, the court granted a temporary restraining order against Henry from violating the pre-trial provisions of the federal securities laws, ordered Henry to pay a civil penalty of $2.5 million, and ordered him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, pay civil penalties of $1.2 million and a $500,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Henry consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $7,500, plus interest of $600,000, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Orleans Office of Financial Regulation, and the Louisiana Office of the Attorney General."
