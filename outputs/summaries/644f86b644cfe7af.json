  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of BladeRoom Group Ltd. and Bripco (UK) Ltd., a microcap company, in an action brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission against them for misappropriation of trade secrets.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that BladeRoom, a subsidiary of Emerson Electric Co., and its CEO, Paul Rogers, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the jury was unable to determine whether BladeRoom was liable for the loss of the contract for Lulea 2 because it lacked sufficient evidence to prove that it owned any trade secrets, or whether it had violated any of the agreed-upon provisions of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, BladeRoom agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $20 million.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On January 17, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, charging BladeRoom with violating Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15a-1 and Rule 15b2-2 thereunder, and seeking a permanent injunction against future violations and a civil penalty.  As part of the settlement, the court also ordered the defendants to provide a copy of the judgment to the jury.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5:15-cv-01370-EJD, 2018 WL 452111, (Aug. 17, 2016).  The court also granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from destroying or destroying any evidence, including documents, documents, or evidence that could be used to prove a cause of action for a trade secret, such as documents, books, or records.  It also ordered that the defendants not violate the reporting provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Exchange Act and Rules 206(3) and 206 (4)-8 thereunder and that the court will determine whether to impose a civil injunction against further violations of Section 12(b)(2) and (3) of Securities Exchange Rules 12b-20, 13b-1, 13a-11, and (4)"
