  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) in a civil injunctive action brought by the American Bankers Association.  The SEC's complaint alleges that the NCUA violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the Commission improperly imposed a mandatory minimum size limit on certain federal credit unions in 1934.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that in 2010 the Commission issued an order requiring certain credit unions to meet certain criteria in order to qualify as a community credit union.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's order, the SEC and the Commission have consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin the Commission from violating the federal securities laws, and order the Commission to conduct an independent review of the Commission\u2019s proposed rule.  On March 29, 2018, the court granted the Commission a temporary restraining order and ordered it to issue an order permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(2)(A), and ordering it to conduct a conduct-based review of its proposed rule, which is subject to court approval.  Among other things, the order requires that the Commission consider whether the proposed rule is reasonable, capricious, or inconsistent with the statutory provisions of the federal credit union laws.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 1759(a)(1) and Rules 5a-5(c) and (3) thereunder, and the complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.   The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael P. Hannan and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's litigation will be led by John R. Rymas. \u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the Office of Management and Examinations and the Division of Enforcement's Retail Strategy Task Force."
