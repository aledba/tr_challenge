  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against a Virginia-based attorney-in-fact charged with making lifetime gifts to a principal.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleges that on September 25, 1993, Agnes Davis (Agnes) and her husband, David Dickey (David) Davis (David), made lifetime gifts of real and personal property to Dickey, including a 90-year lease of one of Dickey\u2019s properties to Burt Honaker (Burt) and a $10,000 cash transfer Dickey made to his brother Garnett (Garnett). According to the complaint, Dickey was not in the mood to make lifetime gifts and instead used the money and real property in Agnes\u2019 transfers to secure a loan to build a barn on the property. The complaint further alleges that Agnes made the gifts to herself, Susan Goforth, Garnett, and Garnett in accordance with the prior purported gifts given by Dickey. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Davis consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The judgment also orders Agnes to pay a civil penalty of $14,000 per person per year. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Davis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Virginia Secretary of State's Office, and the Virginia Department of Banking and Securities."
