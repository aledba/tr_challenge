  "summary": "On May 21, 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment ordering a Los Angeles-based investment advisory firm to arbitrate all of its statutory labor claims.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, alleges that Martin Keith Lane, Jr., a security analyst at a brokerage firm, was hired as an analyst in violation of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, Lane was promised a base annual salary of $150,000, participation in an annual bonus program, and additional benefits, including medical insurance, paid holidays, and vacation.  Instead, the complaint alleges that Lane was not provided a copy of the arbitration agreement.  Lane also allegedly failed to attach the arbitration rules to the contract, and was subsequently terminated.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Lane.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Lane consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains with respect to his right to an officer-and-director bar and a penny stock bar.  Further, the court granted Lane's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from participating in any arbitration proceeding, and granted him the right to return his investment advisory clients' funds to him.  On May 24, 2013, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Lane, charging him with violating Section 229 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0Advisers Act\u00c2\u00a0of\u00c2\u00a01962, and aiding and abetting Lane's violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rules 5a-5, 6a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 206 (2014).  The complaint also charges Lane with violating the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) and (d) of Securities Act, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and penny stock bars against Lane and any other person who seeks to participate in an arbitration proceeding."
