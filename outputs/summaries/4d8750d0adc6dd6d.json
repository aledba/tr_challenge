  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on September 20, 2018 entered a final judgment against RERI Holdings, LLC, a shell company that claimed a charitable contribution deduction of $33 million on its 2003 federal tax return.  The court found that, contrary to the tax court\u2019s finding, the company failed to adequately assess the value of the donated property.  In its judgment, the court held that, in its opinion, the IRS was entitled to a reasonable cause and good faith exception to the charitable contribution provision of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, RER I and its co-defendant, Harold Levine, consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) and of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their respective disgorgement and interest.  According to the court, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (March 21, 2018).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New York today announced criminal charges against R&I Holdings for its violations of Section 5(b).  The Court also issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the company and ordering it to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  On September 22, 2018, the Court issued an order imposing a $82,500 civil penalty against R.I. Holdings, which is the amount the company has agreed to pay for its charitable contributions to the University of Michigan, for a total of $3.4 million.  It also ordered the company to provide an independent valuation of the property in its annual report for the period ending in May 2016.  R&i Holdings agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions and ordering a civil monetary penalty of $2.5 million. The court also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and to the appointment of a receiver to determine the appropriate amount of interest and a receiver for the receiver.   The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  To learn more about valuation and accuracy related penalties, see Investor.gov/Investor.gov.
