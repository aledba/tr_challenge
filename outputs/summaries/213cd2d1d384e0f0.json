  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The court also issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendant's assets, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of ten years in prison.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Newark, New Jersey, Walek P. Dunlap, a convicted felon, was sentenced to ten years of supervised release after having already served four years on special probation. The SEC alleges that the court improperly considered defendant's addiction in finding aggravating factors in finding that he was not entitled to credit for time served on probation because his probation was not as restrictive and confining as a custodial sentence.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions and orders him to repay the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus interest, and imposes a five-year prison term.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey announced criminal charges against Dunlap and issued an order suspending him from appearing before the SEC as a trial judge.  On May 24, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Burt of the U.N. Division of Justice granted the SEC request for an emergency asset freeze and other emergency relief, including an asset freeze, and ordered Dunlap to pay disgorgement of $1,078.95 plus prejudgment interest of $2,829.95 and a $100,000 civil penalty for a second-degree criminal conviction.  Judge Burt also granted the court's request for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 5 of the federal securities laws, ordering a hearing on May 25, 2019 to determine whether to impose a permanent injunction against further violations of the securities laws. The hearing was conducted in the absence of a court order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent review of the books and records of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice. The case was supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the New Jersey Division of Criminal Justice, and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Barry. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter."
