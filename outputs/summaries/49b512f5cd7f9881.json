  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas yesterday entered a final judgment against a Texas man who was convicted of aggravated sexual assault in 1987. The court of appeals found that, on or about August 16, 1987, Freddy Garcia violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Garcia to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  According to the court's order, Garcia consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint.  The court also found that the jury instructions required the defendant to \"unanimously find beyond a reasonable doubt\" that Garcia had penetrated his child step-daughter's sexual organ with his own.  As alleged in the complaint, the jury deliberated for less than an hour, and Garcia ultimately agreed to settle the matter by consenting to an election at the end of the State's case in chief.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Garcia arising from the same conduct. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit, and is being supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner. The case has been supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
