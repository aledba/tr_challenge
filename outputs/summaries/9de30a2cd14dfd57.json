  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the Hendricks County Commissioners, the Sheriff\u2019s Department, and the Sheriff of Hendricks County, Indiana.  The court granted summary judgment on the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment in the wake of the November 29, 2016, shooting death of Bradley.  According to the court order, filed in federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, the defendants were confronted by two Hendricks County officers, Jason Hays and Jeremy Thomas, who told the officers that Bradley was a threat to the officers and would not hesitate to use deadly force. The court also found that the officers were not trained to deal with a person with a mental illness and did not engage in any aggressive or threatening conduct.  Instead, the court found that Hays, Thomas, and Hays violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the officers consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains the defendants from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-officer injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against the defendants. The SEC's complaint charges the defendants with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 and Exchange Act Rules 5b2-1 and 5c-2 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil money penalties, penny stock bars, and penny stock bar against the officers. The complaint also seeks a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 504 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and a civil penalty against Hays. The case is being handled by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division, and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The Court appreciates the assistance of the U.N. Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the FBI, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the United Kingdom Secret Service."
