  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant's motion for a temporary restraining order against him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. Louis, Missouri, alleges that, on December 3, 2004, a Missouri state court granted Taylor's request for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, Taylor was arrested on unrelated charges on November 27, 2004 and was subsequently incarcerated for a total of four felony counts of first- and second-degree murder and four counts of armed criminal action.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the delay deprived Taylor of the ability to defend himself at trial and prevented him from obtaining a fair trial.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendant failed to disclose to the court that he had confessed to the murders of Angela Rowe, Beverly Conley, and Sherry Conley.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Taylor consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000 and bars him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Taylor also agreed to be enjoined from participating in any future solicitation of an officer or director of a public company, and to be barred from serving as a member of any SEC-registered broker dealer, dealer, municipal securities dealer, penny stock dealer, or investment adviser.    In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Taylor.  To learn more about pre-judgment review, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Nov. 26, 2004).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
