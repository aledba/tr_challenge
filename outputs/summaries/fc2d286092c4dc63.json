  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against Donna Black, a D.C. resident, alleging that the Department of Health and Human Services failed to properly screen her for retroactive POWER benefits.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the Eastern District of Washington, Ms. Black raised the issue of whether she was eligible for POWER benefits when she recertified for TANF in February 2014, claiming that she was unable to work because of her daughter's receipt of SSI disability benefits. The complaint further alleges that the agency failed to adequately consider the medical evidence presented by her daughter, and failed to consider the fact that her daughter had been ineligible for the program for many years.  The SEC's Complaint alleges that, in a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins the agency from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the agency to pay her full POWER benefits retroactively to February 2014.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the agency has consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a)(1)(A) and Rule 17(b)(2)(B) thereunder. The order also prohibits the issuance of a cease-and-desist letter or an order suspending or purporting to suspend a person from serving as an officer or director of a public assistance program.  In addition, the court has ordered the SEC to conduct a scheduling conference to determine whether it is appropriate to issue an order imposing a redetermination of eligibility based on the evidence of the daughter's incapacity. The SEC has also issued an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver and ordering the receiver to provide timely and accurate information about the receiver's status. The receiver has also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty in the event of a court order requiring him or her to comply with the agency's work requirements.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 4-205 (a)(7)(F).  In a related matter, the SEC today announced that it has appointed a receiver to determine the timing and amount of payments to be made to the receiver based on evidence presented at the hearing.  A receiver has agreed to the appointment of a receiver and to the payment of a $2,500 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.  Additionally, the receiver agreed to participate in job search and job readiness activities"
