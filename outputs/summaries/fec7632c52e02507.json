  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Utah today announced criminal charges against a former member of a rival gang for his role in a series of high-profile shootings.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that defendant Ernesto Navarro was in possession of a stolen Chevrolet Avalanche.  According to the complaint, Navarro, who was a member of the rival gang, and two of his brothers-in-law were in the car with Navarro when they confronted Navarro.  Navarro allegedly told Navarro that he was going to go fight them and that he had \"throwing up gang signs.\"  The complaint alleges that Navarro agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,038,078, plus prejudgment interest of $2,065, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations in its complaint, the defendant consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains and pay a $150,000 civil penalty, and imposing a $75,000 penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Eric R. Birkenheier and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Utah State Corporation Commission in this matter."
