  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Benham Halali, a San Jose, Calif.-based insurance agent, for orchestrating a scheme to defraud the American Income Life Insurance Company (AIL).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, between September 2011 and Spring 2012, Halali and his co-conspirator, Benham Gagarin, submitted hundreds of fraudulent insurance applications to AIL.  The complaint alleges that the defendants forged signatures on the applications and gave other identifying information of the applicants to increase the likelihood that AIL would grant a policy.  According to the complaint, the defendants then paid about four months of premiums on the fraudulent policies, from hundreds of different bank accounts opened for that purpose, before defaulting.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendants.    The U. S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California today announced parallel criminal charges. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC also announced related civil injunctive relief against Halali.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Gilroy consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of $2,837,791.93, representing the total amount of her ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, plus a civil penalty of $3,829,767.  Gagaran also agreed to a three-level \"manager or supervisor\" enhancement, pursuant to Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, that imposes a penalty of 12 months and a $1,000,000 civil penalty, and that she will be jointly and severally liable with the defendants for the rest of her life.  Finally, the SEC previously issued an order requiring the defendants to pay restitution in the amount of $4,849,767, which was insufficient for the purpose of obtaining a judgment of permanent injunctions.  It also imposed a five-level sentencing enhancement for Gilroy, which is subject to court approval.  For further information, see United States v. Gagnarin, 852 F.3d 1167, 1170, (9th Cir. 2014).   In its order, the court found that Gilroy violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17a-3 thereunder and ordered her to disgorge her ill"
