  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered final judgments against Q Club Properties, Inc., a Florida-based condominium-hotel operator, and two other defendants in a related case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, alleges that Q Club violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to timely respond to a request for a new trial.  According to the complaint, Q Club falsely claimed that it was entitled to a fair and impartial jury when, in fact, it was not.  Instead, the complaint alleges that the court improperly instructed the jury to determine whether the Shared Costs issue was a legitimate question for the jury, and that the jury should determine whether to grant the jury a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Florida today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  As alleged in the SEC's order, the defendants agreed to settle the case by agreeing to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoins them from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint or the defendants' actions, the Defendants consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions, ordering them to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against the Defendants.  Q Club also agreed to a $50,000 penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Florida Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
