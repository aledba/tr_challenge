  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Carlton Davis, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 14 years in prison for the 2003 death of Lakeitha Sims.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Matteson, Illinois, alleges that Davis was at Sims\u2019s mobile home on August 16, 2003, when he and Emanuel Tillman began drinking and smoking marijuana in a car outside of the jail. According to the complaint, Davis told the detectives that he and Tillman had gotten into an argument at a nightclub in Savannah a few weeks prior with a man called \"TKO\" and that he was now coming after Davis. Davis also allegedly told the officers that he needed to get in touch with Rodriquez in order to retrieve some money she owed him for a television he gave to her. The complaint further alleges that when Davis was questioned by the detectives, he told them that he did not mean to harm or kill Sims, but that he had \"never meant for anything \u2013 nothing like this to happen to me.\" The complaint charges Davis with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The SEC also seeks an officer-and-director bar against Davis and a conduct-based injunction against Davis.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Davis arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC's action. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Timothy J. Murnahan and supervised by Amy C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
