  "summary": "On January 4, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Eric Watson, Jr., a New York City resident who was injured in a work-related accident.  The court found that, contrary to the stated intent of the Legislature, Watson was entitled to the full amount of a scheduled partial disability award when he had sustained a permanent partial disability with a 51% loss of wage-earning capacity, entitling him to wage-loss benefits not to exceed 350 weeks.  According to the court's order, Watson died on March 12, 2018, and his compensation for the remaining 38.8 weeks of his nonschedule partial disability was determined upon a determination of the cause of his death by the State Comptroller.  In a parallel action, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) today announced that it has issued an order requiring all injured workers to be entitled to a schedule loss of use award, or a posthumous award, when the injured worker no longer had causally-related lost time or future earnings to lose as a result of his work related injury.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Watson consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 15(4) of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and orders him disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2,500, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000.  On January 5, 2019 the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the New York State Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) granted the Commission's request for a temporary restraining order against Watson, ordering him to return to work, and appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue a civil injunctive action against Watson.  A hearing on February 13, 2019 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Matter of Sienko v. United States Trucking Corp., 204 A.D.3d at 1233, 1365\u20131366, and 204 A/D. 3rd at 1251, 1364, 1366, 1367, and 206 N.Y. State Street Corp. (2014).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Department of Justice, the United States Postal Inspection Service, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
