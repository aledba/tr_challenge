  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a California-based company that misappropriated millions of dollars of investor funds to pay for medical expenses.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that Richard J. Johnson was exposed to known carcinogens during his work as a firefighter for the City of South San Francisco (CSSF) and for Pacifica, Inc. (Pacifica). Johnson was diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer in 2007. The complaint alleges that Johnson suffered a severe bout of lung cancer during his employment with CSSF, and that he was subsequently diagnosed with lung cancer. According to the complaint, Johnson was not liable under Section 5500.5 of the workers\u2019 compensation law for lung cancer, but was liable for compensation for a subsequent lung cancer that arose from his exposure to the same carcinogen. The SEC also alleges that the company failed to rebut the company\u2019s claims that Johnson had developed lung cancer and that it was not a cause-and-effect relationship between the cancer and the cancer. Finally, the SEC alleges that Pacifica failed to adequately rebut its findings, and the company was not required to pay a penalty for Johnson.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the company.  On June 5, 2017, a federal district court in Los Angeles entered a judgment against Pacifica that permanently enjoins the company from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders the company to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Pacifica agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal securities laws. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing on June 6, 2017 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221."
