  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against a Pennsylvania man in contempt of court for failing to comply with a court order requiring him to make monthly payments to his ex-wife.  According to the court's order, filed on January 25, 2007, Alvin D. Cunningham, a resident of Somerset County, Pennsylvania, was found in contempt for failing, without admitting or denying, to pay a $10,000.00 purging condition imposed by a court on him in connection with a divorce settlement.  The court found that Appellant had failed to pay the purging provision of the settlement, and that the court had the power to enforce the court order by means of a civil contempt order.  In a parallel action, on March 20, 2017, a federal district court in Philadelphia issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of Appellee and her husband, and ordering Appelant to pay $111,666.66 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his civil contempt conviction.  On March 21, 2018, Judge David C. Klementik of the Philadelphia Regional Office issued an order requiring Appellemans to submit a written response to the order in which he agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Appelllemans not to violate the provisions of Sections 4132, Attachment and summary punishment for contempt, and 4133, Commitment or fine for failure to pay under the terms of the Divorce Decree.  Appellemeans also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay civil penalties of $1.5 million and $2 million, respectively, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Pennsylvania, charges Appelemeans with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act.  Without admitting to these violations, Appelmeans that he has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay a civil monetary penalty of $100,000, and to be incarcerated for a period of sixty (60) days in the future.  As set forth in the complaint, the court has jurisdiction to determine whether to impose civil penalties against Appel"
