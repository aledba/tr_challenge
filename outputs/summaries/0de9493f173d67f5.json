  "summary": "On August 7, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a defendant who was charged with violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Silver Spring, Maryland, alleges that, since February 2014, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California (\"Securities and Exchange Commission\") filed an enforcement action against Mario Granados-Alvarado, an El Salvadoran citizen and native of El Salvador, charging him with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that the federal government entered into a \"significant legal relationship\" with the defendant when it accorded him SIJ status.  According to the complaint, the SIJ program offered the opportunity to help certain young immigrants legalize their status and to seek permanent resident status. However, as alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the rule of lenity does not apply to aliens who are not in the country at the time of the alleged firearms offenses. Rather, the complaint alleges, the federal agency's definition of \"illegally or unlawfully\" is inconsistent with the statutory construction of the federal criminal statute.  For example, the SEC alleges that when a defendant was arrested for a firearm possession-of-a-firearm violation, the defendant was not \"admitted\" to the country when he was arrested.  In a parallel action, on August 8, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the United Kingdom Court of Justice issued an order suspending the defendant from appearing before the SEC as an attorney.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Sansone consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 922(g)(5) and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The court also granted the defendant's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product, including a firearm, without the court's knowledge or consent, and requires him to provide a copy of the complaint to the SEC for further determination by the court upon motion of the SEC."
