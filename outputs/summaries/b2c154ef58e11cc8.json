  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against former business partners Brad West and Leo Quintanilla, finding that West violated the parol evidence rule by failing to show that he had satisfied his obligations under the 2014 Trading Agreement.  The court also found that, in a parallel action, West agreed to pay $5 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty in the amount of $7 million.  According to the court's order, West also agreed to settle a civil action brought by the SEC and the Texas Commission on Securities and Exchange Commission against him for lying to the Commission about the value of his assets.  As alleged in the SEC's complaint, West was liable for half of the $14 million owed in the March 2015 Sale and owed $4.3 million in interest and a $1 million penalty for the remainder of the year.  In addition, the court found that West could not establish prima facie support for his slander-of-title and fraudulent-lien claims because he knew that West had satisfied those obligations, and that he owed the full amount owed under the 2015 Trading Agreement, in the form of a credit towards the $7million debt.  West also alleges that, by filing fraudulent liens, he failed to show sufficient evidence to support his claims.  Finally, the Court of Appeals held that, based on West's misrepresentations, he was entitled to a large severance payment unless he was terminated \"for cause.\"  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay in the Fort Worth Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in this matter.
