  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant in default on a $2.5 million mortgage on a property in Southampton, New York.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on June 11, 2007, Gregg Lubonty took out a mortgage on the property and filed a bankruptcy petition in federal court invoking the automatic stay and barring continuation of the second foreclosure action for 769 days.  The complaint alleges that the bankruptcy stay was triggered by a court order granting a default judgment in the first foreclosure action.  As alleged in the complaint, the default judgment granted by the court granted plaintiff's request for a temporary restraining order and an automatic bankruptcy stay.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the defendant has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendant in connection with the same action, and the bankruptcy court granted the relief sought by the SEC.  On December 6, 2007 the U. S. Attorney's office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania announced criminal proceedings against Lubontty.  This case is being handled by John Rymas, Trevor Donelan, and Amy Gwiazda of the New York Regional Office.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 206(1) of 2018.  An SEC order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver's receiver was issued on December 5, 2007.  A hearing on January 14, 2010, was scheduled for 6:30 p.m. Eastern.  Following the court's order, the receiver filed an emergency foreclosure action on the same property and obtained an emergency court order to discharge the mortgage.   The SEC's Complaint charges the receiver with violating the federal securities laws and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and injunctive relief.  It also seeks to bar the receiver from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply after a court has deemed it sufficient to determine whether it is reasonable to do so.  Finally, the complaint seeks a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 1501(4) and the appointment of a receiver to determine how to proceed with the foreclosure action against the receiver.
