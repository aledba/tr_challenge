  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Texas resident Craig Schreiber in a civil injunctive action brought by the Texas Department of Commerce.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that, on July 27, 2015, Schmidt and his company, Dynamic Mobile Media, L.L.C., engaged in business in Texas by contracting by mail or otherwise for the manufacture of a custom LED screen. The complaint alleges that Schmidt and Dynamic made several misrepresentations to Munz and UV concerning the nature of Schmidt's contacts with Texas residents, including that he had no minimum contacts with any Texas resident, and that he did not have any reasonable expectation of jurisdiction over Schmidt or his company. In addition, the complaint alleged that Schmidt made numerous misrepresentations in his affidavit concerning Schmidt and the company's manufacturing facilities in Las Vegas, Wisconsin, and Wisconsin. The SEC alleges that the defendants made numerous false and misleading statements in their affidavits to the trial court, including, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, that Schmidt failed to establish a clear jurisdictional basis for his violation of the federal securities laws. The court also found that Schmidt violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) thereunder of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Schmidt to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Schmidt, Schmidt, and other defendants in connection with the same conduct alleged in the SEC action. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, John R. Rymas, and Kurt L. Gottschall of the Dallas Regional Office. The litigation will be led by John K. Brunson and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Aug. 19, 2014)."
