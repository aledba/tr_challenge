  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the District Attorney's Office against Davon Delshawn Moreland, who was convicted of two counts of aggravated kidnapping.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Moreland and his co-defendant, Kevin Adams, violated Section 206(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Sections 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  According to the complaint, Mr. Adams and Adams agreed to settle the SEC's charges by agreeing to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws.  In addition, the court ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Moreland consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the securities laws, and ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  Mr. Moreland agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Office of Inspector General, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
