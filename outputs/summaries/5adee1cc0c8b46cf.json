  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of West Virginia today announced criminal charges against a West Virginia man for aiding and abetting a drug trafficking scheme.  According to the SEC's complaint, Charles C. Williamson pleaded guilty to one count of aiding-and-abetting the distribution of methamphetamine.  The complaint alleges that, in 1986, Congress passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act (ADAA) which established a \"weight-driven\" scheme for punishing drug offenses.  As alleged in the complaint, Williamson received methamphetamine from a supplier, mostly in crystal form, but sometimes in powder.  He would then give at least some of that methamphetamine to Saeger, who was his accomplice and had entered a plea agreement with the government in exchange for her cooperation.  In a presentence report prepared in August 2018, the SEC charged Williamson with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Williamson consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of zero to twenty years imprisonment.  On November 7, 2018, a federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order against Williamson, ordering him to surrender his passport, and imposing a five-year mandatory minimum and a 10-year prison term.
