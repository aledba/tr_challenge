  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was charged with defrauding his father in a business partnership.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that Joe Blair and his father, Joe and Everette Blair, formed Blair Iron and Metal, LLC, in 1994. According to the complaint, the defendants raised the issue of whether to classify the partnership as a \"partner property\" based upon the valuation of the business. The complaint further alleges that the defendants failed to disclose to the trial court that the partnership was in fact a partnership, and that the parties had agreed to treat all of the post-separation distributions as \"management fees.\"  The complaint also alleges that, contrary to the defendants' representations to the court, none of these statements were supported by the facts of the case.  In addition, the complaint alleges that when the parties entered into an engagement agreement with the parties, they did not file the partnership tax returns with the court. Instead, they used the available information to determine whether the partnership should be classified as a part of a partnership and whether it was entitled to a greater than one-half distribution of marital property based upon valuation.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The judgments also order the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their respective profits.  On the same day, the court granted the Defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, entered a consent order appointing Betsy H. Fonvielle, CPA, as an expert witness to conduct an appraisal of the partnership. The court also granted the defendants the right to request a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from destroying or destroying any evidence, including documents or records, that support their claims of being entitled to equitable distribution based on valuation. The Court also ordered the parties to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to a final judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and order them to pay civil penalties of $100,000 each.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval."
