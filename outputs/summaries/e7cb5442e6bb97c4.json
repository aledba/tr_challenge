  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a California-based physician who has been charged with overprescribing controlled substances in violation of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that Dr. Emil Soorani violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, from at least June 2012 through June 2015, the Board issued subpoenas to six patients to obtain and review medical records related to their treatment. The subpoenas were issued after the Board's medical consultant reviewed the CURES report, identified specific patients subject to irregular prescribing patterns, and opined that he had \"an extremely potent narcotic with a very high risk of unintentional overdose.\"  The complaint further alleges that the subpoenas only came after the medical consultant had reviewed the medical records of the six patients and failed to show sufficient evidence to justify the unreasonable demands.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as an attorney, Dr. Klessig failed to present any evidence of reasonable cause to justify her failure to comply with the subpoena requests.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the board consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2020, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Dr. Waidla, who was charged with violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act.  A hearing on June 26, 2020 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Consumer Affairs, Division of Investigation, and Health Quality Investigation Unit in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling or offering them advice on how to protect themselves from securities fraud and other securities fraud.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
