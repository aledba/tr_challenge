  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against defendant Martin Muschinske in a civil injunctive action brought by his wife, Patricia Stokes.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that, on March 28, 2013, Stokes was driving a pickup truck towing a horse trailer loaded with equipment when he rear-ended and injured his wife.  According to the complaint, after hearing testimony from numerous experts and other witnesses, the jury found that Stokes had been named as a defendant in two prior lawsuits, and that he should have been able to determine whether to reduce his damages by a reasonable amount simply because he had insurance.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the jury deliberated for only about two hours during trial, during which time Stokes failed to disclose to the jury that he had received compensation for his injuries and damages from Kaiser Permanente and Kaiser.

On May 17, 2009, the trial court found no misconduct in the first instance, and granted the motion for a new trial on July 23, 2010. The court also denied the defendant\u2019s motion for an emergency court order requiring him to show cause and effect, including a copy of the complaint filed in the federal district court for the Central District of New York, to provide an accounting of past and future medical expenses, and to provide a bar against Stokes from appearing or practicing before the court as a juror in a public proceeding.
