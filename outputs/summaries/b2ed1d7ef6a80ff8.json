  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern and Southern District of New York on August 30, 2018, entered a final judgment in favor of a motion to dismiss for improper venue.  According to the court's order, filed on June 12, 2017, Judge Learned Hand, a federal district court judge in Delaware, issued a temporary restraining order preventing the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

This order also prohibits defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including in the event of an emergency, of any type of emergency, including an officer-and-director bar, a penny stock bar, or an officer and director bar.  It also requires that defendants pay a civil penalty of at least $150,000.  Finally, the Court granted the parties' motion for a partial injunction against future violations, ordering the defendants"
