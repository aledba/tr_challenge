  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former computer programmer for his role in a scheme to steal millions of dollars of confidential information.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that David A. Aleynikov, a computer programmer who was initially charged with stealing confidential information from Goldman Sachs, stole a large volume of confidential source code from Goldman's computer servers.  According to the complaint, the SEC alleges that, in a parallel action, the New York State Attorney General's Office (AGO) filed an emergency action on May 2, 2013, denying the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordering Aleyn to be barred from the federal securities laws for five years.  In its order, the AGO also issued an order temporarily suspending the defendant from appearing or practicing before the SEC as a witness in a case that was being handled by the SEC.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Aleyov consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.   The court's order also prohibits Aleyv from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product or service, and prohibits him from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, penny stock dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. McKinley."
