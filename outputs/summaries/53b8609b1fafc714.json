  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Stages of Beauty, LLC, a California-based cosmetics and services company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Diego, California, alleges that, in violation of the federal securities laws, Stages provided false and misleading information to the SEC in its complaint concerning the automatic renewal and continuous service offer terms.  According to the complaint, the SEC alleges that Stages failed to adequately disclose to its customers that it had a private right of action and that it was entitled to the right to cancel its automatic renewal program.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating these provisions.  In its order, the court also entered a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  On May 24, 2017, the Honorable Judge David J. Rymas granted the SEC request for a preliminary injunction, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar.  To determine whether to impose a civil penalty on Stages, the Court issued an order requiring the company to provide a copy of the Complaint to a court-appointed receiver.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17604(a)(1) and Litigation Alert No. 20620 (Sept. 14, 2017).  The Court also granted the company's request for an officer and director bar and a penny stock bar, and ordered it to pay a $1,000 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
