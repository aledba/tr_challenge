  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Anthony Loader and Stephanie Loader, a Will County, Illinois attorney who was barred by the court from representing clients based on conflicts of interest.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago on January 1, 2010, Anthony and Stephanie agreed to the entry of judgments that permanently restrains their ability to represent clients in the same proceeding.  The SEC alleges that the court improperly barred Anthony from serving as an attorney under Rule 1.7 of the Illinois Rules of Professional Conduct, which requires a court to determine whether a defendant has a conflict of interest in representing two or more clients, and that Anthony was entitled to custody of the children based on his uncontested paternity of each child.  In addition, the court found that Anthony had no standing to challenge the disqualification of counsel and that he was not qualified to represent both clients.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Anthony agreed to be permanently barred from the practice of representing clients subject to the rule.  Anthony also agreed to a temporary restraining order prohibiting him from associating with third parties not covered by an attorney client relationship, and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  On August 10, 2017, Anthony filed a petition to disqualify from representing either Anthony or Stephanie in a civil proceeding against Debra Grossi, Debra's second husband, and Gregory LaCost, a third defendant in a criminal case. The complaint also alleges that Anthony failed to disclose to the court that he had signed a cease-and-desist order that prohibited him from representing his clients in court proceedings that were unrelated to the litigation or other proceeding that was being handled by the defendants.  Finally, the complaint charges Anthony with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Gibson. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Jennifer C. Barry and Eric R. Werner, with assistance from David A. Kasper, and was supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The examination was conducted in the Office of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York and the Division of Criminal Justice."
