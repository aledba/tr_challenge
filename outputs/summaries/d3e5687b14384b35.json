  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wyoming today entered a final judgment against a Wyoming man who was convicted of two counts of first-degree sexual abuse of a minor under W.R.E. Rule 404(b).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Wyoming, alleges that Joseph LaJeunesse, who was previously convicted of the same charges, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint further alleges that, in 2015, when C.L. was seven years old, he and her father initiated sexual contact with her while she was in the shower.  According to the complaint, the alleged victim told her father had stuck his tongue out a little bit and licked her potty with his tongue.  In a parallel action, the federal district court in Jackson, Wyoming, on January 31, 2017, granted the SEC's request for a continuance of the trial, which was subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, La Jeunesse consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,078, which will be offset by a civil penalty of $100,000 and a $50,000 civil penalty, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On May 31, 2016, the court granted the request for an emergency asset freeze and a temporary restraining order, which is required by the court to prevent future violations.   The case was supervised by Jennifer C. Barry, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Wyoming Department of Justice, and the Wyoming State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
