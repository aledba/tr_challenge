  "summary": "On June 28, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a final judgment against CareOptimize, LLC, a Florida-based healthcare management consulting firm, and its two former principals, Joseph N. De Vera and Jonathan N. Shivers, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Shawna Matonis, an Ohio citizen and healthcare management consultant, made numerous false and misleading statements to clients, including: (1) that Matonis was suffering from an ongoing health problem that affected her ability to work on their accounts; (2) that she was in violation of a non-solicitation agreement; and (3) that her relationship with the Care Companies was in jeopardy because of her ongoing health condition; (4) she had been on vacation since July 2018; (5) that the false statements on Matonis' website caused her to lose her job and (6) her reputation as a professional who promptly returns her client's messages.  The SEC's Complaint alleges that the Care Optimize defendants violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Florida's Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(c) thereunder, and that Defendants violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of those provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Matonis consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against her from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Matonis also agreed to a settlement where she will be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Matonis.  On May 21, 2020, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against De Vera, Quirk, Shivers and De Vera for violations of Section 15 of the Exchange Act and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder; and, on May 24, 2020 against DeVera for violations under Section 206(3).  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and penny stock bars against all defendants, as well as a permanent officer and director bar against all"
