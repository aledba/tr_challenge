The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling or offering them investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related case, the SEC charged Actavis and its subsidiary, Actavis Holdco, Inc., with violations of Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1.
