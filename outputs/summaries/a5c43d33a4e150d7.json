  "summary": "On February 12, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a final judgment against Mitsubishi Motors Corp.'s (MMS) motion to compel arbitration pursuant to the terms of an arbitration agreement.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Miami, Florida, alleges that the Federal Arbitration Act of 1940 (\"FAA\") requires that all arbitration agreements be valid and enforceable.  According to the complaint, the FAA requires that parties to an agreement to arbitrate a dispute to have an arbitrator determine the validity and enforceability of the arbitration.  For example, the complaint alleges that, under the agreement, a party to the arbitration agreement must have a clear and unmistakable delegation of issues of arbitrability to the arbitrator.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants for their roles in the alleged scheme.  On February 13, 2020, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in federal court against the Defendants, charging them with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting the Defendants' violations of Section 206 of the Exchange Act.  To learn more about arbitration, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 13, and No. 17-cv-1 (2014).  The Complaint also charges the Defendants with violating Section 206, and seeks a temporary restraining order, an injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar.  Finally, the Complaint charges the defendants with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Rule 206 (4) and Rule 206(5)-8 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an order requiring the parties to pay a civil penalty of $100,000 or more.  It also seeks an order appointing an independent arbitrator to determine whether the parties are bound by the arbitration provisions of the Agreement, and to determine the jurisdiction of the court for each of the parties.   The complaint also seeks a preliminary injunction against future violations, a bar against future issuance of false or misleading press releases, and the appointment of an independent arbitration judge."
