  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Robert L. Hamilton, Jr., a former United States Postal Service employee who was convicted of making a false or fraudulent statement for the purpose of obtaining compensation under the federal workers' compensation law in violation of Insurance Code section 1871.4, subdivision (a)(1).  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, Hamilton was injured on November 28, 2014, due to slipping and falling while delivering packages.  The complaint alleges that Hamilton, who was a federal employee at the time of his injury, was able to perform certain physical acts that he told his doctor he could do, but could not do.  As alleged in the complaint, Hamilton's inability to return to work was based on Hamilton's statement that he could drive only short distances, had persistent pain which required the use of narcotics, and needed to use a cane or walker to get around in order to obtain FECA benefits.  Hamilton was also charged with attempted petty theft by false pretenses, which is a federal felony.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Hamilton, charging him with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $11,972.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Hamilton consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with a federal offering of or offering of any security, including the right to reapply for the security of his or her retirement.   The SEC's investigation was conducted in the Office of Inspector General and supervised by Marc Blau. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Health and Human Services, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
