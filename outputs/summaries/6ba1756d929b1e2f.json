  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered final judgments in favor of Craig Roper in a civil injunctive action brought by his wife, Erin Roper.  The court found that Craig violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered him to pay $4,000 of his wife\u2019s attorney fees.  According to the court order, Craig agreed to settle the matter by agreeing to pay a portion of the amount owed to him in the form of a partial settlement agreement.  As alleged in the complaint, Craig also agreed to reimburse Erin $1,000 in child support and $2,427 in attorney fees for the remainder of the year.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Craig.  On June 28, 2018, the court granted Craig a temporary restraining order and ordered that he pay $3,101.50 of the total amount owed in the settlement agreement, which is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Craig consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposes civil penalties against him.   The settlement agreement also prohibits Craig from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any automobile, other than a Cadillac Escalade, or a Chevrolet Silverado.  Craig also has agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and to pay disgorgement of $1.4 million plus prejudgment interests of $2.8 million.  Additionally, Craig has agreed not to cooperate with the trial court in determining the amount and duration of his child support payments, and to be ordered to pay an attorney fee of $402.32 per month for the remaining five years of his and Erin's marriage.  To comply with the final judgment, Craig will be required to show cause and effect, including a copy of the SEC order, that he has complied with all of the requirements of the law, and that he will not be liable for the amount of any child support payment that he receives.
