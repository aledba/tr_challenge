  "summary": "On May 6, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered final judgments against two former co-owners of Meehan Construction, Inc., a now-defunct Ohio-based construction company.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that, beginning in 2007, John Howard Mardis and Lonnie G. Horn violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that in 2008, M.ardis, then a member of MMCI, began diverting M.&rsquo;s money, including $900,000 for \"additional supervision\" in connection with a Mariott hotel project in Atlanta, Georgia in 2008. Mardi and Horn then allegedly used the money for unrelated business purposes, including transferring some or all of the funds to Horn, MMC Group, Artistic Tile, or TBG Properties L.L.C., despite having no interest in those projects. M.G. and Horn also allegedly misappropriated the money and property of M. G. and M.M.G., as well as from M.g. and G.G.'s projects.  M. g.and Horn allegedly misused the money to pay M.gtquo., a company he controlled, and to purchase a piece of foreclosed real property using the proceeds of the alleged fraud.  In a parallel action, on May 8, 2015, the Ohio Court of Appeals granted partial summary judgment in favor of Meghan on all of his claims for breach of fiduciary duty and conversion. The court also granted preliminary approval of MEG's motion for summary judgment.  On June 19, 2018, the court issued a temporary restraining order halting Megahn's alleged violations of the federal securities laws and ordered him to pay disgorgement of $1.75 million, prejudgment interest of $2.2 million, and a civil penalty of $150,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Megha has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of Exchange Act Rule 206(4)-8, and orders him to disgorge $1 million in ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties of $100,000, and pay a $20,000 officer and director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office."
