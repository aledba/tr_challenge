The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that Defendants violated the due process provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) the federal securities laws, and the pre-judgment provision of Section 3 of the Bail Reform Act of 1984. In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to show sufficient evidence to support their claims that a minimum delay of seventy-two hours before a bond hearing is required for defendants to post a secured bond.

The judgment also imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar, and requires defendants to submit written statements to the court explaining why they are not entitled to the same level of due process and equal protection that the court requires of defendants. In a separate administrative proceeding, the court granted the defendants' request for preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and ordered them to submit to a court-ordered injunction. The order also prohibits defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply for a court order upon motion by the court upon motion of the court.
