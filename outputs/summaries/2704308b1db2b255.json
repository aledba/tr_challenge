  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Michael Edward Overley, a California resident, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Jersey on May 2, 2018, Overley placed a \"listing\" on the website of Hemmings.com advertising for sale his 1960 Buick Invicta convertible. The listing disclosed to would-be buyers that Overley had not previously sold a car through the website, and that he was not in the business of selling cars or even conducting business with the forum state. The complaint further alleges that overley did not engage in sufficient purposeful communications with the seller to establish personal jurisdiction over him in this state.  The SEC's Complaint against Overley alleges that, contrary to the representations of the complaint, the seller and Overley engaged in a one-shot affair, in which Overley solicited the purchase of the car from a nonresident Florida resident, accepted an offer from a New Jersey buyer, and had the car delivered to New Jersey.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against the seller.  On May 24, the U. S. District Judge for the Northern District of California granted the court's order, ordering Overley to pay $40,000 in disgorgement, $39,500 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC Complaint, the court also granted the motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, ordering the purchase and sale of a car, and appointing a receiver for the receiver. The court also issued an order suspending Overley from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and ordering him to pay a $20,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer and director bar. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Department of Commerce, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice Criminal Division, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
