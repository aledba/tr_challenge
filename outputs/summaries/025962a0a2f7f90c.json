  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment against a Connecticut-based nonprofit corporation for denying its application for a special exception to construct a school and offices for charitable institutions in Southport, Connecticut.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that, on June 16, 2015, the Planning and Zoning Commission denied American Institute for Neuro-Integrative Development, Inc. (AIGD), a private school that provides educational and therapeutic services for students with complex neurobiological based learning and developmental disorders.  According to the complaint, the Commission improperly denied the application on the basis of its finding that the proposed use of the former high school building did not meet the technical requirements of Section 5.1.4 of the regulations.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Connecticut today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  AIGD's complaint charges the defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 and $20,000, respectively. \u00c2\u00a0The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (Aug. 28, 2015).  The Commission's investigation was conducted in the Office of Inspections and Examinations of the Connecticut Department of Education, and the litigation will be led by Michael J. Birkenheier.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Connecticut Office of Inspector General, the State Department of Health, the Department of Justice, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis and the Connecticut Secretary of State's Office.   The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit."
