  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment in favor of the T's in an emergency action to intervene and seek custody of two of their daughters.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Louisville, Kentucky, alleges that A.C. and D.M. T., of Kentucky, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, T&rsquo;s filed a motion to intervene in a custody case involving K.C., a daughter born December 5, 2016, and K.M., a sister born December 6, 2015. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 620 of the Exchange Act, which requires the court to determine whether a person with a history of domestic violence or substance abuse should have custody of the children.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In addition, the court granted the defendants a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the defendants from destroying or destroying the records of any person who has filed a complaint with the SEC, and granted them the right to return the children to their parents.  On November 13, 2018, the trial court entered an order denying the defendants\u2019 motion for immediate entitlement to custody, which is required by federal law.  A hearing scheduled for November 14, 2018 is scheduled for December 21, 2018.  To learn more about temporary custody, see Litigation Release No. 645, 188 (Ky. App. 2017).  In a related case, the U. S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants for their roles in the alleged misconduct.  For further information, see Criminal Action Task Force No. 566 (N.Y. AG. 2018).  The case was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Kentucky Division of Criminal Justice.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the litigation was conducted by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Kentucky Department of Health and Family Services, and the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
