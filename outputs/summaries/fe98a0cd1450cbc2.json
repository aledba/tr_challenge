  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment against Devon Energy Production Co., L.P. and others not parties to a settled civil action brought by Fernando Flores and his family.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albuquerque, New Mexico on May 23, 2013, alleges that the Estate of Fernando Flores, who was electrocuted while working as a helper at a New Mexico well site, failed to adequately consider whether any of the defendants owed a duty of care to the decedent.  According to the complaint, the Estate sought a court order that would determine whether the duty was owed to Mr. Flores.  In its order, the court found that, contrary to the Estate\u2019s representations, the duty owed was not reasonable and should not be relied upon as a matter of law.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the estate consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of any civil penalty.  On May 24, 2014, the Honorable Judge Steven J. Snyder granted the Estate's request for a temporary restraining order against further violations of the federal securities laws, ordered the Estate to comply with the court order, and appointed a receiver to oversee the receivership of certain of the receivers of the receiver.  Judge Snyder also granted the estate's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and ordered the receiver to provide a copy of the final judgment to the receiver, which is subject to approval by the court upon motion of the estate.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against McVay Drilling Co. Ltd., Inc. (McVay), alleging that it violated Rule 5-b.  It further alleged that the estate violated Rule 11-407, which requires defendants to show cause and effect in a civil proceeding before they are liable for liability for any injury or death caused by their work.  Finally, the complaint alleges that, in a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Mexico announced criminal charges against the Estate for its role in the alleged violations of Rule 5a-5.   The complaint seeks a permanent injunction from future violations, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar.  To settle the SEC's case,"
