  "summary": "On February 5, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey entered final judgments in favor of the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (DBA) in its ongoing litigation against the Department of Insurance in connection with the reimbursement of overpayments of claims for health and dental benefits.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Newark, New Jersey, alleges that the DBA violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that, in violation of the federal securities laws, DBA only allowed payers to obtain reimbursement of claims paid under \"stand-alone\" or \u201cdental-only\u201d plans. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Department has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins DBA from future violations of the securities laws and orders DBA to pay a civil penalty against the payer. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the N.J. Attorney General's Office announced criminal charges against Vitale. The litigation will be led by Mark Vitale and supervised by Amy Gwiazda. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Department of Health and Human Services, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
