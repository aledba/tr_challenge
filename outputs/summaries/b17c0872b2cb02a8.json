  "summary": "On October 11, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky entered a final judgment in favor of the biological parents of a Kentucky child who was subsequently reincarcerated for drug-related violations.  The court also issued an order temporarily restraining the parents from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the parents.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Kentucky, the court found that the parents violated Section 5 of the federal securities laws by failing to provide sufficient evidence to justify the termination of their parental rights.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the parents consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of Section 5(b).  The final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions, orders them to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and requires them to comply with a court order requiring them to provide a copy of the final judgment to each parent-respondent within thirty (30) days of the court's order.  On October 13, 2018, the family court entered an order permanently restraining the father and mother from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(2)(A), and ordering the father to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and the mother to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $100,000.  It also ordered the mother and father to cooperate with the court in determining the amount of restitution to be paid in the parallel criminal case.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Kentucky Office of the Attorney General's Office and is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kentucky Department of Health and Family Services, the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Criminal Investigations, the Commonwealth of Kentucky Criminal Investigation, the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation and the Kentucky Division of Criminal Justice."
