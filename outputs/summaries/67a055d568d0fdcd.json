  "summary": "On January 12, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Ricky Lee Smith, Jr., a former Social Security Administration employee, for filing a false and untimely request for review.  The court found that Smith violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its judgment, the court held that Smith had sixty days to file a written appeal with the SEC, and that the SEC had no jurisdiction to review the SEC's decision.  According to the court's order, Smith failed to timely file a response to his application for review, which was not included as an exhibit in the SEC&rsquo;s final decision on the matter.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Smith consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal due process laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  On February 18, 2014, a federal district court in New York granted Smith a temporary restraining order and ordered him to surrender his right to reapply for his Social Security benefits.  Smith also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  A hearing was conducted by videoconference before ALJ Robert Bowling on March 26, 2014.  This hearing followed a hearing conducted by a different ALJ than the one that presided over his hearing.    The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Mark Cottrell and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
