  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter for the August 24, 2013 stabbing of a Revere, Massachusetts man.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges that John Fay, who was a friend of Fay's, engaged in a long-running verbal tussle with another man who was also a victim of the alleged stabbing. The complaint alleges that Fay and the other man engaged in the tussling, which resulted in the victim's death. According to the complaint, Fay told the victim that he had been drinking vodka and sniffing cocaine when he confronted the man and confronted him about his actions. The SEC alleges that the defendant replied, \"I don't remember where I was. I'm just scared to death.\" The SEC also alleges that, during the course of a 2010 trial, the defendant made repeated, loud outbursts at the victim and the defendant, and repeatedly kicked and punched the victim. The court found that Fay violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $500,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Fay consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The judgment also prohibits Fay from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to a jury trial, and prohibits him from associating with any third party.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Connecticut today announced criminal charges against Fay.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone entered final judgments against Fay and Sansone, finding him liable for a total of 17 felony counts, including one count of attempted murder. The final judgment against Sansone orders Fay to be permanently barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The jury will determine the amount of disgorgement and penalties to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (2014).  The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit."
