  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan yesterday entered a final judgment against a Michigan-based attorney who was charged with defrauding a family member out of millions of dollars.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Allegan County, Michigan, alleges that Janice Rowland and Kenneth Prins violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by appointing Harold Gerstler as Harold\u2019s guardian and conservator.  According to the complaint, Rowland falsely claimed that Harold had a history of satisfactory care for his father and that he was financially independent.  Instead, the complaint alleges that Harold was engaged in \"financial abuse,\" \"talked [he] into giving her money,\" and attempted to \"coerce\" Angelee into giving it to him.  In addition, the court found that Angelee had no history of substance abuse and that she did not charge her father for rent or any of his living expenses.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Harold and Prins consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against each of them.  On December 9, 2016, the Court granted the court's motion for a temporary restraining order against Angelee, and ordered her to return to Texas to continue her duties as a public guardian.   The court also ordered Angelee to provide evidence to support her claims that she was incompetent to serve as a guardian and a conservator, and to provide for the safety and security of her family.  Angelee agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the securities laws and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  She also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  A hearing scheduled for Jan. 20, 2017, was conducted by Michael McClellan and Carol Murnahan, and supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the Chicago Regional Office.  An examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and the litigation will be led by Ms. Welshhans and Ms. McGrath. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Department of Health and Human Services, the Michigan Department of Banking and Securities, the U."
