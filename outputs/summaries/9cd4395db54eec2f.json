  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today announced that it has entered a final judgment against a Kansas man who was convicted of 14 felony charges.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, alleges that Steven W. Ponds filed a premature notice of appeal on June 26, 2017, alleging that the district court improperly dismissed his motion for reconsideration.  According to the complaint, Ponds' motion was filed after a district court found him guilty of all of the charges, including aggravated burglary, attempted burglary, and theft, and the court found that Ponds was entitled to a permanent injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the court had unlimited review to determine whether the motion was valid.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  Ponds also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Ponds.  On May 3, 2017 a federal district court entered judgment in favor of Ponds in a mortgage foreclosure case on June 24, 1991. The court found Ponds liable for a total of 244 months in prison and ordered Ponds to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The district court also issued an order suspending Ponds from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and ordering him to pay an $8,000 civil penalty.  A federal court has jurisdiction over Ponds's appeal of the judgment in this matter.  To learn more about premature notices of appeal, see Kansas Supreme Court Rule 183(j) and (e) Rules 183(a), and (c) thereunder. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kansas Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Kansas Attorney General's Office Criminal Investigations, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the Criminal Division's Office of Inspector General, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice's Criminal Justice Division's Retail Strategy Task Force, the Missouri Department of Banking and Securities and the Kansas Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Insurance Regulation."
