  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the defendant and ordered him to surrender his passport.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Jersey, on May 6, 2018, a Monmouth County, New Jersey man was arrested on an outstanding warrant for a gun-related arrest. The complaint alleges that the arrestee's hands were swabbed at the time and place of the arrest, and the officer was informed by another witness that the defendant had recently fired a gun. The court's order, which is subject to court approval, prohibits the officer from conducting a search without a warrant, and orders the officer to submit a copy of the warrant to the court. The SEC's order also prohibits the search of the defendant's person for any reasonable reason other than the fact that the person was unlawfully arrested and in police custody.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against the man.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The final judgment also orders the defendant to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  On May 8, 2019, the court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction against the search and seizure of defendant's hands and other evidence related to his alleged involvement in the April 2, 2018 shooting. The order also provides for the officer and director of a public safety agency to conduct a background check on the suspect and to determine whether the officer has sufficient background to detect any suspicious activity in the person's possession.  For further information, see SEC v. O'Hagen, 206 N.J. 442, 516, 126 A.2d 467. The Court granted the request for a permanent injunction against further unreasonable searches and seizures, and ordered the officer/director bar to comply with the court's orders. The investigation was conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Criminal Investigations, with the assistance of the FBI's New Jersey Field Office. The litigation will be led by Scott A. Kasper and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry."
