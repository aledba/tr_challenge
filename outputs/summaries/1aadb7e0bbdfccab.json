  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire today entered a final judgment against Reilly O. Leith, a New Hampshire resident charged with stealing merchandise from a Kohl's department store.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Hampshire, alleges that Leith violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Leith consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,174, which is equal to the amount of the stolen merchandise.  Leith also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with a criminal investigation.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant agreed to a judgment permanently enjoining her from violating the above-mentioned provisions.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Hampshire announced criminal charges against Leith.  To learn more about the SEC, see SEC Litigation Release No. 637:11, II(a).  The complaint also alleges that the loss prevention officer failed to disclose to the court that she created the inventory form as part of a business record, which was prepared in the course of a regularly conducted business activity, and that she was forced to prove her innocence by establishing the \"actual value\" of the items stolen.  As a result, the jury found Leith liable for a class B felony and ordered her to disgorge her ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay a civil monetary penalty, and be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Additionally, the court ordered Leith to surrender her passport and to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  On May 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court against the defendant, charging her with violations of Section 13(a) of Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, as well as aiding and abetting Leith's violations of Rule 12b-20, and ordering her to return her stolen merchandise to the company where it was purchased.  This action is subject to court approval.  A hearing is scheduled for June 5, 2018.  For further information, see Court Order No. 803 (2017).  In its order appointing a receiver of stolen merchandise, the Commission issued an order requiring that the receiver of recovered stolen merchandise be certified as a \"qualified witness\" by the court."
