  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the city in a related case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, in 1940, the New York City Department of Buildings issued a Zoning Resolution that prohibited outdoor advertising on public transportation properties.  According to the complaint, the city then issued an order requiring outdoor advertising signs located on public property to be exempt from the city's anti-smoking regulations.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2008, the federal district court in New York issued a temporary restraining order preventing the city from enforcing its own anti-discrimination laws.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, this order violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the City has consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from violating the federal securities laws, and from enforcing certain of the state's other anti-regulatory laws, including Section 15 of the Exchange Act and Rule 15a-1 thereunder, as well as Section 17(a)(1) and (3) the Securities Act of 1933.  It also ordered the city to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $20,000 and a $50,000 civil penalty, and to pay an officer and director bar.  Finally, the court granted the City's request for an emergency asset freeze and other emergency relief, including an asset freeze, an emergency telephone line, and an officer-and-director bar. The court also granted the city the right to appoint a receiver for the receiver of the receiver and to issue an order appointing a receiver pursuant to Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1. The receiver will determine the amount of any civil penalty to be imposed by the court upon the receiver. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
