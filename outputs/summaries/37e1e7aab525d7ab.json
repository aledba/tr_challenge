  "summary": "On June 12, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered an order requiring the attorney in charge of the Hampden County District Court Department to provide defense counsel to indigent defendants in criminal proceedings.  The court's order, which was entered on June 13, 2020, required the attorney to provide counsel to certain indigent criminal defendants in the district court and other court-ordered cases.  According to the order, the attorney could not provide counsel because he or she was unable to handle the cases at a particular time.  In addition, the order required that the attorney be present at the arraignment of the indigent defendant, and that the assistant district attorney and deputy chief counsel of the District Court should be present to assist with the selection of counsel.  As a result, the office's caseloads declined significantly over the last two years, and the office was forced to issue an emergency order appointing additional staff attorneys to cover certain of the defendants' duty-days.  On June 11, the first justice of the Springfield District Court issued a temporary restraining order halting the appointment of new staff attorneys in the office.   The order also required the office to provide additional defense counsel for certain defendants who were in custody at the time of their arrest.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Attorney General's Office and the District Attorney's Office have agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the attorney-client relationship to be reviewed by the single justice or the district attorney.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release Order No. 13-20-20 (1911).  The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments in an investment in a real estate development project. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Massachusetts Bar Association, the Massachusetts Department of Justice, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Office of Insurance Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Boston Regional Office, the Department of Banking and Securities and the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office."
