  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Judith Tulleners, a California resident who filed for divorce in May 2016.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, from at least May 2016 through at least June 2017, Judith received a 54 percent credit in her husband\u2019s pension benefit and later a 401(k) plan.  According to the complaint, Judith was able to provide a calculation from the administrator of her public employment retirement plan for the percentage of her pension payment that was community property and separate property.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, however, the calculation did not make a finding of the value of the property in the marriage.  Instead, the complaint alleges that Judith received $553,472 in community property, approximately $184,500 less than the $738,172 total of community property it awarded to Andre in that earlier divorce.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Judith consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC charged Andre with violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and ordered him to pay $1.5 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  On August 2, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Northern District of California entered a judgment against Andre, ordering him to disgorge $1 million in ill-gotten gains plus interest, imposing a $500,000 civil penalty, and appointing a personal representative to represent him in the case of a default judgment.  Judith agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently restrains her assets and prohibits her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, other than for the purpose of recovering her pension.  Judgment against Judith also ordered her to repay the $1-million civil penalty she received in the earlier administrative proceeding.  A final judgment ordering Judith to pay the civil penalty of $375,000 was entered without prejudice to Judith, and against Andre for the same conduct as in the previous administrative proceeding against her.  Judge Himes also ordered Judith to return her pension funds to her husband, Andre"
