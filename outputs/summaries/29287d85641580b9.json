  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment in favor of a Kentucky man who was sentenced to death for his role in three murders.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Bowling Green, Ky., alleges that, in January 1983, Leif Halvorsen and Mitchell Willoughby shot and killed three college students and their family members in their Kentucky home.  According to the complaint, the defendants had been convicted of the three murders and were sentenced to life in prison.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the jury deliberated for nearly three hours before concluding that the defendants were not guilty of any of the charges.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the trial court improperly instructed the jury not to consider the defendant\u2019s claims that he was not a threat to society, and instead directed the jury to consider whether he had acted as a principal or as an accomplice to each of the victims.

Finally, the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the defendants from using the internet, from making material misrepresentations about the nature of their criminal history, and from participating in any offering of a penny stock.  On May 24, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Ky. entered a judgment against Halorsens, ordering him to surrender his passport and to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  Halvesens also agreed to the appointment of a trial attorney, and agreed to a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from making materially false or misleading statements to the court.
