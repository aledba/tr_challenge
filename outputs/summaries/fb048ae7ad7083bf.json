  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments in favor of the Hedlunds and Leimbach Development LLC in a water-drainage case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Fort Pierre, Mississippi, the defendants sought preliminary injunctive relief against River Bluff Estates LLC and its predecessor, VIB Enterprises LLC, in connection with an alleged increase in drainage on their properties.  The complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15b-5 thereunder, and that the court improperly granted the defendants preliminary injunctions and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $55,000.  In its order, the court also denied the defendants\u2019 requests for a preliminary injunction and ordered VIB and VIB to pay civil penalties of $75,000 each.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil monetary penalty, and a penalty equal to the amount of their profits.  VIB also agreed to be enjoined from violating Section 15-26A-3 of the Exchange Act, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for the rest of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2016.  River Bluffs also agreed not to pay any civil monetary penalties.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
