  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Jonathan David Talley, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for second degree murder and second degree kidnapping in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, on July 1, 2016, the defendant entered the residence of his mother and stepfather and told his father that he was going to shoot them in the head.  According to the complaint, shortly before the defendant's arrest, he allegedly took out a gun from the drawer of his desk and showed it to his father, who was standing near his bedroom door when the shooting occurred.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, after the defendant confronted his father about the gun, he shot his mother in the back of the head and at a distance of at least three feet away, as A.K. attempted to kick him out of the house.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On November 2, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against Talley.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Talley consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.

For example, on June 30, 2016 at approximately 6:00 p.m., the defendant removed a firearm from his desk at his father's home and showed the defendant a note that said \"Sudden passion and heat of blood.\"  The note further alleges that the defendant replied, \"My Daddy just poof shoot her [sic].    [i]   I'm going to kill you, Daddy.\"   In addition, the complaint alleges that on the day after the shooting the defendant threatened his mother with a gun"
