  "summary": "On March 27, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Douglas Songer, M.D., finding that he was not entitled to control weight when he found Plaintiff not disabled and therefore unentitled to Disability Insurance Benefits (DIB).  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, Songer's opinion, which was not supported by substantial evidence, was inconsistent with the medical record as a whole.  The complaint alleges that, based upon his opinion, Plaintiff had \"marked limitations\" in areas of concentration, persistence, and maintaining a sustained rate of work at all exertional levels but with certain non-exertional limitations.  As a result, the complaint alleges, Plaintiff continued to suffer from distractibility, depression, and anxiety.  In a second opinion, the court found that the defendant had marked limitations in certain areas of her functioning, including: (1) her ability to focus on work activities and to stay on task; (2) she had difficulty with her social work; (3) she was doing well today but had a major meltdown yesterday; (4) her positive response to psychiatric medications and treatment, and (5) her overall well-being in a work setting.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078.71 plus prejudgment interest of $2,077.71, a civil penalty of $100,000, and a $50,000 officer-and-director bar.  An SEC order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue a temporary restraining order against Songer and ordering him to conduct an independent review of the case, will be followed by a hearing on May 24, 2017.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-14222, May 9, 2014."
