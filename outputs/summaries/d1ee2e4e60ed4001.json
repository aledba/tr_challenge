  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a Santa Rosa, California-based media company and its owner for defrauding the public.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Santa Rosa on October 20, 2016, The Press Democrat and two other media defendants, Kevin McCallum and David McCuan, raised more than $200,000 to support two candidates for the Santa Rosa City Council.  The complaint alleges that the articles were defamatory because they implied that plaintiff Bill Gallaher was the source of the funds spent by Flater, his son-in-law, and another media defendant.  As alleged in the complaint, Flater had spent nearly $192,000 on mailers and canvassing in the 2016 election, and that he did not give the money directly to either candidate.  Instead, the complaint alleges, the articles raised questions about whether Flater or people close to him are exploiting gaps between state and city campaign finance laws to maximize payments to other candidates.  In addition, the SEC alleges that Flater and his wife, Shantel Jackson, recently reported spending nearly $40,000 in support of two other candidates during the 2016 municipal election.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaints, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders them to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar.  On November 11, 2017, the court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $1,192,192. The court also granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 425.16 of the federal securities laws, ordering them to comply with the court order, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against Flater. The SEC also instituted an administrative proceeding against the media defendants for violating the anti-SLAPP provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  To settle the SEC case, defendants agreed to pay civil penalties of $2,500 each, and to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.
