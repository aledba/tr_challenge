  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Terron Lamar Bryant, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 46 months in prison for an attempted robbery and attempted robbery of a mail carrier.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, Bryant was convicted of two counts of attempted robbery, one of which was a felony, and the other of a felony.  The complaint alleges that Bryant used a dangerous weapon to commit the attempted robbery in violation of Section 2114(a) of the federal securities laws, and that he was liable for a 10-year maximum and subsequent felony for the same conduct.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Bryant, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 924 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Bryant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.  Bryant also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to a five-year officer-and-director bar.  On May 2, 2019, the court entered final judgments against Bryant against him, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and ordering Bryant to pay civil penalties of $25,000 and $50,000, respectively, for each of the three felony counts.  As a result of the court's order, Bryant has been barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in any federal district court for at least five years.
