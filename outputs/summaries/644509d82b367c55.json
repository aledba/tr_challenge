  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Ramon L. Ellender, who was convicted of driving while intoxicated in violation of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans on October 9, 2015, Ellender was charged with operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated.  The complaint alleges that, prior to jury selection, he had been in trouble with the law for virtually the entirety of his adult life.  As alleged in the complaint, he was the only person to make himself known at the time of the alleged DWI hit-and-run, and he was on parole for a prior DWI fourth offense when he was arrested for driving under the influence.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Ellender.  Ellender has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $5,000.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to be restrained and restrained from appearing or practicing before a jury.  Without admitting or denying Ellender's allegations, the court also agreed that the amount of his sentence should be determined by a six-person jury, not a twelve-person one.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Rymas of the New Orleans Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.N. Office of Inspector General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigations, the Louisiana Department of Banking and Securities, the Mississippi Department of Insurance, the Alabama Department of Health and Human Services, the New York Department of Corrections, the FBI's Criminal Intelligence Division, the State Department of Homeland Security, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Criminal Justice Department's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, the Missouri Department of Financial Regulation, the Texas Department of Securities and Exchange Commission, the Kentucky Department of Revenue, the DeRidder Police Department's Criminal Justice Division, and various state agencies.\u00c2\u00a0In its order to determine whether to impose mandatory hard labor, the SEC requires that a jury be comprised of at least twelve persons, including officers and prosecutors, and that a judge consider the facts of the case before imposing a penalty.
