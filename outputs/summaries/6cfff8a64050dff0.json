  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was sentenced to 35 years in prison and ordered to pay a $2,000 civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that, on September 10, 2016, Dequavis Turner and a friend got into an argument via social media with the defendant holding a gun. According to the complaint, Turner confronted the defendant with the gun and kicked him in the face, resulting in injuries to Turner\u2019s eye and a loss of two front teeth. The complaint further alleges that the defendant abandoned his motion for a new trial and instead used a standby counsel to represent himself during the trial. The SEC alleges that Turner and the Appellant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the trial court improperly handled the matter of whether Turner was capable of good lawyering and whether he had a valuable constitutional right to a jury trial.  In its judgment, the court found that Turner violated Section 16-11-131 and Rule 16-13 thereunder. The court also ordered Turner to cooperate with the SEC in its investigation of the matter.  Turner consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The judgment also prohibits Turner from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any firearm, other than a gun, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2018, the U. S. District Judge in Atlanta granted Turner's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to comply with the court's order. On August 20, 2018 the court appointed trial counsel as standby counsel. On September 13, 2017, Judge Dunaway issued a judgment against Turner, ordering him to serve a total of 35 years, with the first 15 years \"served in confinement\" and the balance of the sentence as determined by the court at a later date. On June 19, 2019, the same court granted Turner a hearing in which he agreed to consent to the appointment of trial counsel. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against Turner. The case was investigated by the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office, which conducted an examination of the case. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Jennifer C. Magee and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Atlanta Office."
