  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against a Kansas City, Missouri man who was charged with arson in 2009.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Topeka, Kansas, Frank Robinson, a former state fire marshal, and his law firm, Paul Bieber, were hired by the Kansas Attorney General's Office to conduct a habeas corpus hearing to determine whether Robinson was entitled to a new trial.  The complaint alleges that Robinson's lawyer, Joseph Huerter, and a fire investigator, Gene Gietzen, convinced Robinson to cooperate with the government's arson investigation, which was conducted by the agency's fire investigators.  In fact, according to the complaint, Robinson was not an expert on the cause and origin of a fire and did not have any expertise in determining the cause or origin of the fire.  Instead, the complaint alleges, he relied on testimony from one of Robinson's defense attorneys, who corroborated his claims that he had been smoking crack cocaine in the hall of the apartment and could have thrown lighted matches on the floor when he saw Robinson fleeing the flames.    The court also found that Robinson was deficient in his performance as a defense counsel because he did not rely on the expertise of his state and federal fire investigators, nor did he have access to any evidence to support his findings. \u00c2\u00a0The court's final judgment, which permanently enjoins Robinson from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, orders Robinson to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and orders him to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Robinson consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil penalty of $25,000.  Robinson also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, including securities in exchange for an officer-and-director bar, a penny stock bar, and an officer and director bar.  To settle the case, Robinson agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations, to be enjoined, and to a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  He agreed to the appointment of a forensic expert, who will conduct a thorough examination of the evidence and determine whether there is sufficient evidence to justify a finding of guilt."
