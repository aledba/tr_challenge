  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of North Dakota today entered a final judgment against the North Dakota Secretary of State for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Fargo, North Dakota on July 26, 2019, alleges that North Dakota violated the federal and state securities laws by failing to enforce the residential street address requirement.  According to the complaint, the federal district court previously issued a temporary restraining order against North Dakota's secretary of state from enforcing the requirements.  In its order, the court found that the residential address requirement imposes a substantial burden on many Native American voters, including many who are not registered to vote.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, the Secretary of state consented to the court's order, which permanently enjoins him from violating the federal, state, and local securities laws, and requires him to provide an affidavit or other form of proof to prove he or she is qualified to cast a ballot.  On August 1, 2017, the District Court entered a preliminary injunction against the District of Columbia and ordered the Secretary to comply with the court order.  As part of the settlement, the Court granted the defendants' request for a temporary injunction, which is subject to court approval, to the issuance of a permanent injunction, and to the appointment of a receiver to determine the amount of relief that will be granted to the defendants.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-04.1 (January 24, 2019).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in the Division of Justice's Criminal Justice Division."
