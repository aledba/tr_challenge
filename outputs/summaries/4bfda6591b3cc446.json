  "summary": "On May 11, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma entered a final judgment against the Oklahoma Corporation Commission against Dobson Telephone Company d/b/a McLoud Telephone Company pursuant to the provisions of the Oklahoma Universal Service Fund.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Oklahoma City, alleges that the Commission improperly denied funding to Dobson for costs incurred to relocate its telephone facilities as required by the city of Oklahoma City for a street-widening project.  According to the complaint, Dobson sought reimbursement under Subsection (K)(1)(b) of the OUSF for the costs incurred by the provider. The complaint alleges that Dobson failed to prove that the expenditures at issue were necessary to provide primary universal services to customers in rural, insular, and high-cost areas, and that the reimbursement was not authorized to pay for such services.  Dobson's application was denied on June 15, 2017.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that, in violation of the federal law, the Commission violated Section 139.106 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Rules of Order.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin the Commission from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and orders the Commission to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The Commission's order also prohibits Dobson from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any order or order. The court also granted the Commission the right to request a temporary restraining order and to conduct an independent review of the matter.  On June 16, the court granted the SEC request for an emergency asset freeze and ordered a hearing on June 17, 2017 to determine whether to issue an order imposing a temporary asset freeze or an asset freeze. The hearing was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern on June 18, 2017 and will be followed by a public hearing on July 24, 2017 in which the Commission will consider the merits of the case. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Oklahoma Secretary of State's Office, and the Oklahoma Attorney General's Office in this matter."
