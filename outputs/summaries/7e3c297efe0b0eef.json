  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against a Missouri man who was convicted of child molestation in the first degree.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbia, Missouri, alleges that Timothy McWilliams violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  McWilliams has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, McWilliams also agreed to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an expert witness.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against McWilliams.  On December 22, 2014, the court granted a motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered McWilliams to return to court on January 3, 2020.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint filed in the United States District Court in Missouri, the Court granted McWilliams\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction and ordered him to comply with the court order and to provide an accounting of the amount of money he has already spent on the purchase of a home and on the construction of a new home.    The court also granted the SEC the right to conduct an independent examination of McWilliams, including to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant an order imposing a permanent injunction, imposing a conduct-based injunction, and appointing a receiver for McWilliams and his family to conduct a forensic examination of the home. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
