  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Thomas Carrano, Jr., a New York City man charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Carrano conspired to violate the federal securities laws by making numerous false and misleading statements to a jury in connection with a purported cockfighting conspiracy.  Carrano's complaint alleges that, in building the case against him, Carrano sought a judgment of acquittal or, in the alternative, a new trial.  According to the complaint, the jury found Carrano liable for the violations of the charged provisions.  In a parallel action, on June 22, 2018, a federal district court in Brooklyn, New York, entered a judgment against Carrano that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078, plus prejudgment interest of $2,038, and a civil penalty of $750,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provision, ordering him to disgorge $1.058, and ordering a $500,000 civil penalty.  On July 20, 2017, a jury returned an indictment charging Carrano with a single count of violating the Animal Welfare Act, which requires defendants to show cause and effect in a pre-trial proceeding to determine whether to consent to a judgment that imposes a permanent injunction against future violations, orders Carrano to pay a $1 million civil penalty, and requires him to provide a copy of the complaint to a court-appointed receiver.  To learn more about co-defendants like Carrano and his alleged involvement in cockfighting, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-19, July 17, 2018.  For further information, see Criminal Justice Release No-10-20, July 24, 2017.   The complaint also names Carrano as a defendant in violation of Rule 206(3).  The court also ordered Carrano not to participate in any cockfighting activity, including any that occurs outside of the United States.  It also ordered him to submit a written statement to the court stating that he would not participate in a cockfighting operation unless he had a reasonable basis to do so."
