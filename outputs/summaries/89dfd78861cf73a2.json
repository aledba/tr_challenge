  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio on October 17, 2018, entered a final judgment against Franklin County, Ohio, that permanently enjoins the county from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b)(5) of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1.5 million.  The court also granted the County's motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the company, and ordering the company to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Columbus, Ohio on August 23, 2016, the County filed a complaint in the United States District Court against the County alleging that it violated the federal and state securities laws by failing to develop a comprehensive storm sewer map and to submit a list of on-site sewage disposal systems connected to the MS4. The complaint also alleges that the County failed to adequately develop a Stormwater Management Program and an Illicit Discharge Detection and Elimination Program, as required by the federal law.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as alleged in the complaint, the county failed to implement a stormwater management program and to detect and remediate the illicit discharges.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the Court granted the Court's motion to dismiss and ordered the County to comply with the court's order.  On November 9, 2018 the court granted the Commission's request for an emergency asset freeze and other emergency relief, including an asset freeze, an emergency court order, and an officer-and-director bar.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt of the Public Finance Abuse Unit in the Chicago Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Jeffery C. Cox and supervised by Amy C. Hershfang. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Department of Environmental Quality, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Secretary of State's Office and the Ohio Division of Health and Human Services."
