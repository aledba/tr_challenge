  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the California Department of Environmental Quality (DOEQA) and its former executive officer, Richard Corey, for violating the agency's pre-judgment review requirements.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Sacramento, California, on April 25, 2014, the Department of Energy and Natural Resources issued an order requiring the agency to submit an environmental impact assessment (EIR) by the end of the year to determine whether a project had a significant impact on the environment.  The order also required that the agency consider the impact of the proposed changes on small and mid-size trucks, and that it should consider whether the proposed modifications would have any significant adverse effect on the air quality.  In addition, the order requires that the Board consider whether it has sufficient evidence to determine if a project has significant adverse environmental impacts.  For example, the court found that the DOE had not conducted a sufficient environmental impact analysis prior to the implementation of the 2014 regulations.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the DOE has agreed to the entry of a final order that permanently enjoins it from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws and orders the DOE to conduct an independent review of the DOE's compliance with the proposed regulations. The DOE has also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to be offset by an officer-and-director bar and a penny stock bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation was conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Analysis and Detection Center, and the litigation will be led by John R. Rymas. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and to identify whether there are any conflicts of interest.
