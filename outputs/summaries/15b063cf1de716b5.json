  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a New York City man accused of repeatedly lying to his mother and telling her that he had raped her.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that the defendant told his mother that she had been sexually abused as a child and that defendant did a \"bad touch\" to her by putting his penis inside her \"front private part\" and \"with his penis.\"  According to the complaint, the defendant also allegedly told her mother that he did it with his penis and that she did not believe it was a second incident.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, contrary to the defendant's claims, the jury was under the mistaken impression that the two rape counts in the indictment were based on two separate incidents of abuse, when, in fact, defendant had done it three separate times.  As a result of the jury's misstatements, defendant was not denied a fair trial by the court.  On the same day, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against the defendant, ordering the court to determine whether to hold a hearing on the matter at a later date.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000 and a $100,000 civil penalty, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and from participating in the issuance of any officer-and-director bar in any federal district court proceeding.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Pendergraph and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey State Attorney General's Office, and the U.N. Secret Service in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221."
