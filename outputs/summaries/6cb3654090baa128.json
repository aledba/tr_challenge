  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Hawai'i yesterday entered a final judgment against the State of Hawai\u2018i in a civil action brought by the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Hawaii.  The court found that the State violated its duty to protect and preserve public trust lands by failing to adequately monitor the use of the leased land.  According to the court order, filed on April 3, 2018, the State alleges that, in 1964, the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) entered into a lease agreement to lease land in the P\u0101hakuloa area of the state for military training purposes. The court ruled that the lease agreement required the DLNR to remove any live or blank ammunition or other materials from the leased property, and that DLNR failed to do so.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the state consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering it to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General (OIG) today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing litigation action by the Department of Homeland Security, which is continuing to investigate the matter. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Hawaii, charges the State with violating the federal securities laws and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar. The complaint also seeks a preliminary injunction against future violations of the securities laws, and seeks a permanent injunction against further violations.  On April 4, the court granted the request for summary judgment on the merits of the case against the state, and issued an order appointing a receiver to handle the litigation.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for May 10, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (January 24, 2018).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Hawaii Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Office of the Inspector General in this matter."
