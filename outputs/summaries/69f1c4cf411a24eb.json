  "summary": "On January 18, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a final judgment against Thomas Combs, a 24-year-old Ohio man convicted of telecommunications harassment.  The court found that Combs violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and entered a default judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  According to the court's order, Combs agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Combs.  Combs has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction and a conduct-based injunction, which prohibits him from soliciting or acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in securities, from making or selling any offer or offering to sell securities, and from participating in any offering or offering of any securities in connection with the alleged conduct. The SEC's order also prohibits Combs from associating with any person who is a convicted felon with a prior conviction for telecommunications harassment or a prior criminal conviction for securities law violations. The court also ordered Combs to pay a $75,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer and director bar. Combs also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 30, 2017, the Ohio Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order and issued an order freezing the assets of Combs' employer, Cecelia Freihofer, a social worker and forensic interviewer employed with the Mayerson Center for Safe and Healthy Children at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. The order also ordered the payment of a $25,000 penalty. The amount of the civil penalty will be determined by the court upon motion of the court.  A hearing on the matter has been scheduled for June 24, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2019.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Harshbarger and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Marc Blau. The case is being supervised by Amy C. McKinley.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio Department of Health and Human Services."
