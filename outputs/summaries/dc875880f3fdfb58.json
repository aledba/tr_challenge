  "summary": "On July 18, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama entered an order granting the debtors' request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Madison County, Alabama, alleges that Steven Ray Shickles, Jr., a self-directed IRA, purchased a 30% membership interest in House Divided, LLC (\u201cHouse Divided\u201d) just days after the Debtors filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.  According to the complaint, Swoboda's actions were not excepted from the automatic stay under the bankruptcy code, and he was not required to post a bond in order to be released from custody.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Swobodie's actions amount to coercion or harassment intended to gain an unfair advantage over the other creditors in violation of the court's orders.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay disgorgement of $11,126,850, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $925,000.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  On August 19, 2020, the SEC filed an emergency action seeking an emergency court order halting the asset freeze, freezing the assets of the debtor, and imposing a civil injunctive action.
