  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against Officer Michael Gutierrez of the Los Angeles Police Department and Officer Everardo Amaral of the City of Los Angeles for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, alleges that, on February 10, 2015, J.N.G., Michael Sanders, and Abdul Wooten, were among a group of school-aged youths who were confronted by an individual holding a toy gun.  According to the complaint, Gutierrez was the initial officer who confronted the individual and directed the other officers to arrest him.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Gutierrez.  Among other things, Gutierrez has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,000.  Gutierrez also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years and ordered to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Gutierrez consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and Section\u00c2\u00a010(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules 5b2-1 and 5c-3 thereunder, and ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interests, pay civil penalties of $2,500 each, and pay a civil officer and director bar in the amount of $3,500.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Marc Blau of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the California Department of State Attorney General, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
