  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the SEC's motion for a temporary restraining order against a defendant who was found incompetent to perform work-related activities.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that on April 29, 2015, a federal district court in Manhattan issued a finding finding that a defendant had suffered a severe impairment in her right knee, requiring her to have multiple surgeries to repair the injured knee and to undergo a post-correction osteotomy of her right tibia.  According to the complaint, the court found that plaintiff's subjective symptom testimony, which was consistent with prior findings, was inconsistent with the evidence presented in the complaint.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendant received routine, conservative treatment for her subjective complaints, including multiple cervical and lumbar epidural injections, multiple cervical spine surgeries, trigger point injections, and epidural steroid injections.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar in the amount of $10,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John R. Rymas of the New York Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper.   The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
