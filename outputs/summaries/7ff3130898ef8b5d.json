  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a California-based ice cream manufacturer for its failure to comply with a court order requiring it to submit an accounting of excess capacity in its production lines.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 1, 2006, from 2003 through 2005, plaintiff operated a production line that produced bulk ice cream, sold in half-gallon containers, and manufactured novelty ice cream products.  The complaint alleges that, in 2003, 2004, and 2005, the facility was operating at 53.2, 65.3, and 63.5 percent capacity, respectively, when it was supposed to be at 100 percent capacity.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the company did not meet its burden of proving economic obsolescence because it did not have the capacity to produce the ice cream.  Instead, the complaint alleges, plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it had excess capacity, and failed to show any external forces that caused it to overutilize its capacity. The complaint also alleges that the company's expert, Timothy Selgelid, testified that he had been with plaintiff for almost four years, and he had not worked for plaintiff during most of the 2003 to 2005 time periods which plaintiff's arguments about excess capacity were based upon its own experience.  Selgelida also testified that, from studying the market, he had trouble understanding how the value of the equipment and personal property in the preexisting production lines was affected by external forces, such as lack of market demand.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Selgelido.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the federal district court in Los Angeles, the SEC today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action, obtained a temporary restraining order, and obtained an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue an asset freeze. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Office of Economic and Risk Analysis, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."
