  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon today entered a final judgment in favor of a former educational assistant who filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim against a public company.  The court found that, contrary to the court\u2019s order, the company had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also found that the company violated the reporting provisions of Sections 656.019(2)(a) and (c) thereunder of the federal securities laws. In addition, the court ruled that, as alleged in the complaint, the employer had a right to a two-year limitation period for its claims against the company. According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, this limitation period was not sufficient for the company to meet its obligations under the federal reporting requirements. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against the employer, charging it with violating the reporting requirements of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2)(A). The complaint also charged the company with a violation of the reporting provision of Section 15(b)(5)(A) and a related provision of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the U. S. Attorney\u2019 s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant. The SEC &rsqua;s case is being handled by Eric R. Krieger, Kelly L.
