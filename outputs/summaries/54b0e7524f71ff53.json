  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Devon Energy Production Company, L.P., a Wyoming-based oil and gas company, and its then-director, Gregory G. Gould, in a related action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, from at least 2002 through 2005, Devon failed to show that its gas was in marketable condition when it received an order from the Department of Natural Resources to unbundle certain of its transportation allowances.  According to the complaint, the ONRR's 2005\u20132007 order required that Devon unbundle its transportation allowance, which is required by the federal law.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the 2005-2007 order expressly prohibited Devon from unbundling its allowance.  For example, according to the SEC's Complaint, in 2005 and 2007, Devon claimed that it was entitled to take 60% of the allowance when it was required to do so.  Instead, the Complaint alleges that in those instances, Devon overstated its allowance and overbundled its allowance by more than $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Devon consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,094,063.  It also imposes a $50,000 civil penalty against Devon for violating the reporting and allowance provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act, and requires the company to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court.   The complaint also seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Devon.  Finally, the SEC seeks a temporary restraining order, an accounting, an officer-and-director bar, and an officer and director bar against Devon from participating in the issuance, purchase, sale, or promotion of any oil, gas, or condensate industry. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Matthew McGrath, and supervised by Scott Frost, under the supervision of Assistant Chief of the Salt Lake Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. McGrath and Mr. Frost. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Colorado Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
