  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arkansas today entered a final judgment against defendant Anthony Baumann, Jr. on a charge of second-degree sexual assault of a minor, E.S., for which he was sentenced to twenty years' incarceration in the Arkansas Department of Correction.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas, alleges that Baumann violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Baumann was charged with one count of rape in the fourth or fifth grade and was convicted of ten counts of sexual assault in the second degree.  Baumann pleaded guilty in a parallel criminal case to one charge of child molestation.  In its judgment, the court held that the amount of similarities between the allegations of Baumann and those of his daughter was sufficient to warrant a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, Bailey has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $15,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, from participating in any future solicitation of the purchase or sale of a home or business, from purchasing or selling any home, from making any investment in a home-based business, to participating in an offering of a penny stock, to purchase or sell a home, and from engaging in any other conduct other than oral and vaginal intercourse.   The court also granted Baumann's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from associating with anyone with whom he has a history of misconduct, from conducting any type of criminal activity, from entering or entering a home with a child, from using a computer, from accessing the internet, to making any phone calls, from anywhere in the world, to using a smartphone, to make a phone call, or from using the internet to make an appointment with a lawyer.  It also ordered Baumann to provide a copy of the Complaint to the jury, which will be reviewed by the court upon motion by the SEC. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert on the subject of alleged child sexual abuse in the United States.
