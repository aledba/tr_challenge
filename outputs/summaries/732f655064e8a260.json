  "summary": "On December 7, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of West Virginia entered a final judgment against the West Virginia Department of Taxation and Review, finding that it violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that the valuation methodology used by the Tax Department violated the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Marshall County, West Virginia, the tax department used a \"statewide mass appraisal system\" for valuation of active and reserve coal properties for tax purposes. The complaint alleges that the methodology used in this method is inconsistent with the federal law and does not meet the statutory requirements of the federal tax laws. The SEC alleges that, in reality, the methodology is simply a collection of data that is used to determine the true and actual value of a coal property.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for West Virginia today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  To learn more about valuation of coal properties, see Litigation Release No. 589, 582, 466 S.E.2d. (1957).  The SEC's Complaint, filed under seal in federal court in the District of Columbia, charges the IRS with violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the IRS has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the above-mentioned provisions and orders them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their respective property taxes. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see SEC Complaint No. 17-cv-01 (2014).  In its order, the court also issued an order requiring the IRS to conduct a fair and accurate valuation of all coal properties. The court's order also requires the agency to develop a plan for the valuation of the coal properties that it deems reasonable and uniform across the state.  On January 24, 2019, the Court granted the SEC\u2019s request for an emergency asset freeze and a temporary restraining order against further violations of the anti-fraud provision of the Exchange Act and Rule 15a-3 thereunder and a court order prohibiting the IRS from imposing any such freeze or other administrative relief. The order also prohibits the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order, and requires the SEC to provide an accounting of the alleged over-valuation."
