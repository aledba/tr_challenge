  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon today entered a final judgment against a defendant who has agreed to settle the SEC's charges against him.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, alleges that defendant, who was in the Army at the time, made multiple false statements to a jury in a series of text messages that he sent to his ex-wife.  According to the complaint, the jury was told that defendant had a history of verbal and physical abuse and that he had suffered a traumatic brain injury.  In addition, the complaint alleges, defendant allegedly sent multiple messages to Getskow, telling her that he was ending their relationship because she \"had to end her relationship.\"  The complaint further alleges that, in addition to those statements, defendant also allegedly sent a number of threatening emails to his mother and an email to his first ex-wives.  As alleged in the complaint filed in the U. S. District court for the Eastern District of Washington, defendant made numerous false statements in the text messages, including one in which he allegedly told his mother that she had leukemia and/or being in a car accident, and another in which defendant had threatened to \"crash\" his car.  He also allegedly texted and called his mother several times and falsely reported to the police that his mother had stolen prescription medicine from him. The complaint alleges that the court improperly admitted all of those statements to the jury.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, defendant has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of Exchange Act Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. The judgment also enjoins defendant from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of a penny stock, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $10,000.  On the same day, the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order against defendant and ordered him to return to his home state of Illinois, where he lives, to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  To settle the case, defendant agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No."
