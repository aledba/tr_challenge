  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment in favor of a Missouri man who lost his hearing due to exposure to industrial noise while working at Solo Cup Company.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. Louis, Missouri, alleges that Shawn Guinn suffered hearing loss and tinnitus as a result of his exposure to harmful industrial noise over a prolonged period of time.  According to the complaint, Guinn's hearing loss was caused by occupational exposure, and he had sustained a disability in the form of hearing loss.  Guinn also allegedly suffered a hearing loss related to work exposure.  In a complaint filed in 2005, the Commission found that the statute of limitations for claims for occupational deafness began to run on January 17, 2013, the date that Guinn filed his claim against the Fund.  On May 7, 2014, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Guinn, and ordered Guinn to settle his claims by consenting to a permanent injunction.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 287.430 of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, a $50,000 civil penalty, and a $100,000 penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-14.  This case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry, Ms. Boggs, and Mr. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
