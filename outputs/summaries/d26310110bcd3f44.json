  "summary": "On September 4, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a final judgment against Florida-based Goldsmith International, Inc. (\"Golfsmith\"), a Minnesota-based car manufacturer, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that Goldsmith and its president, Brett Hamrick, violated Sections 5(a)(1) and 5(c) of Florida's long-arm statute.  Goldsmith agreed to settle the SEC's action by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Goldsmith from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement of $97,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000. Goldsmith also agreed to pay a $75,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the SEC today announced that it filed a civil action against Goldsmith, alleging that it had violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act and that it was seeking a permanent injunction and a return of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest from Goldsmith.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants agreed to a settlement where Goldsmith will be permanently enjoined from future violations of Section 5 and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 and $1 million, respectively. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  On November 12, 2014, the Florida Court granted the SEC and the Florida Attorney General's Office the request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze. The court also issued an order temporarily freezing the assets of Goldsmith as well as other emergency relief.   The court's order freezes the assets and proceeds of the Goldsmith case. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Eric Werner. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Braunstein.
