  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a California-based lawyer who was disqualified from representing a client in a mandatory settlement conference.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, alleges that Judge Elsa Ba\u00f1uelos, then senior counsel with the law firm of Ballard Rosenberg Golper & Savitt, acted as a mediator in a settlement conference conducted by a judge and two volunteer attorneys.  According to the complaint, the judge and attorney who conducted the conference were not present when the settlement conference took place.  Instead, the complaint alleges that the judge, who was not present at the time of the conference, overheard the attorney discussing the client's case with the judge during the conference call.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the lawyer.    In its order, the court also issued a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the lawyer from participating in settlement conferences, from providing evidence in support of his or her clients' claims that he or she learned of or had been privy to confidential information concerning a defendant's case while serving as a settlement officer in one of the settlement conferences. \u00c2\u00a0The court's order also prohibits the attorney from associating with a law firm that is not registered to represent a defendant in a court-sponsored settlement conference, and from representing himself or her in a case involving a defendant who has been convicted of a felony.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,078, which will be determined by the court upon motion by the parties.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Chun Barry of the Los Angeles County District Court issued an order granting the SEC request for an emergency asset freeze and other emergency relief, as well as an order appointing a receiver to monitor the progress of the litigation against the defendant.  This order also requires the court to determine whether to impose a \"cone of silence\" to prevent the defendant from discussing the matter with the receiver, and that the receiver must provide a copy of the judgment to the receiver.  Finally, the order requires the receiver to provide an accounting of the defendant's progress in the litigation. "
