  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon for his role in a child molestation case.  The court entered the final judgment on consent against Cody E. Reynolds, Jr., who was sentenced to six years and three months in prison for the same conduct.  According to the court's order, filed on August 2, 2017, Cody, who was employed as a night-watchman at a restaurant at the time of the alleged molestation, told the court that he had learned of the child's alleged abuse from his mother, and that he used lotion to trick the child into feeling his penis.  He also allegedly told the judge that he would \"spit on his wife's hand\" if she asked him to.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Cody.   The SEC's complaint charges Cody with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Cody consented to the entry of a final judgement that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and a $20,000 officer-and-director bar.  On August 9, 2018, the court granted the SEC a temporary restraining order against Cody and ordered him to surrender his passport and return to the United States.  To learn more about child molesting, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (Feb. 12, 2019).  The case was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Criminal Division, under the supervision of Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Indiana Department of Justice, and the Indiana State Corporation Commission in this matter."
