  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on January 4, 2017, entered a final judgment against a Pennsylvania driver who was not warned that he would be subject to enhanced criminal penalties for refusing to submit to a blood test.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 17, 2016, Trooper Timothy McConnell of the Pennsylvania State Police responded to a single-car accident scene where there was a Buick Rendezvous lying on its roof in a ditch.  The complaint alleges that, at the time of the accident, Licensee was arrested for violating Section 1547(b)(2)(ii) of the Vehicle Code, which required a police officer to warn a driver about the potential consequences of refusing a test of blood.  As alleged in the complaint, in order for a license to be suspended, the officer had to obtain a search warrant for a sample of his blood, which he did not do.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed criminal charges against Licensee.  On January 3, 2018, the Court of Common Pleas of Pennsylvania issued an order suspending Licensee from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any blood test, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of up to 12 months.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000, $20,000 in disgorgement, and $1,500 in prejudgment interest, and imposing a one-year officer-and-director bar.  Defendants have also agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 16(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 16b-5 thereunder, and to pay an $80,000 civil penalty in the amounts of $100,000 and $50,000 each.  Licensee has also agreed that, in the absence of a warrant under the search-incident-to-arrest exception to the warrant requirement, he will not be liable for enhanced penalties under Section 16a-3 of the Securities and Exchange Act.  Finally, the court granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered the suspension of Licensee's operating privilege, which is subject to approval by the court.  A hearing on February 24, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m."
