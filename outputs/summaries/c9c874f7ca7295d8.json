  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of permanent maintenance for a de facto marriage between a husband and wife.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Tazewell County, N.Y., alleges that Jared Fogle and Amy Churchill were engaged in an intimate, continuing conjugal relationship.  According to the complaint, Jared and Amy were married on March 27, 1999, and had two children, born September 7, 1999 and October 18, 2002. The complaint also alleges that Amy and Jared had been in a relationship between 8 and 12 months; they met after Jared moved to the area in November 2016, and began dating in February 2017.  As alleged, Jared spent significant time together as typical of a new relationship but did not participate in the day-to-day living activities of the newlywed couple.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, during the marriage, Jared was cohabitating with Amy and spending significant time with her, including going to the movies once and bowling several times with her children.  Jared also spent time at Amy's house in the fall of 2016 and occasionally spent the night at her house, which was normal dating behavior for a married couple. The court also found that Amy's father, who also lives in the area, was not involved in the relationship and was not entitled to permanent maintenance.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgments also order the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $10,000 per month, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and the payment of civil penalties in the amount of $1,500,000. The defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the anti-manipulation provisions of the federal securities laws and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge David J. Burt of the U. S. District court for the Northern District of Michigan granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order, ordered Amy to return to her home state, and ordered Jared to pay civil penalties of $100,000 each. The judge also granted the parties' request for a preliminary injunction, which prohibits them from associating with anyone other than their spouses."
