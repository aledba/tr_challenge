  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against a Kansas man who was convicted of two felony counts of second-degree murder and two counts of criminal possession of a firearm.  According to the SEC's complaint, on October 19, 2005, Christopher Schley drove Sheppard to a house party and told him that he was going to put his girlfriend to sleep. The complaint alleges that Schley was arrested in 2006 based on an affidavit that contained false information and that the reason he waited 11 years to challenge the facts set forth in the affidavit was because he was afraid of being arrested without probable cause. Schley allegedly told Sheppard that he planned to put her to sleep and that he would \"put [her] to sleep.\" The complaint further alleges that Sheppard followed Schley's instructions to get out of the car and drove off together, leaving Schley to fend for himself in the car. The SEC alleges that the complaint was filed in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"). The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Kansas Division of Criminal Justice. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Amy C. McKinley. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for Kansas and the Kansas Secretary of State's Office."
