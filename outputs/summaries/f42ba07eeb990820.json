  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio yesterday entered a final judgment against Chesapeake Exploration, L.L.C., a drilling company, and its owner, Richard Simmers, in a related action.  The court found that Chesapeake violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also found that, under the common-law rule of capture, a landowner has an incentive to quickly drill his well, regardless of the waste, because if he fails to capture the resources, his neighbor will drill his own well and take it all for himself.  According to the court's order, Chesapeake and Simmers violated the federal securities laws by failing to comply with the required registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) of Exchange Act Rule 5b2-3. Without admitting or denying the court\u2019s findings, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal registration provisions, ordering them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties of $10,000 each. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Simmers. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Ohio Department of Natural Resources in this matter."
