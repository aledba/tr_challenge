  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Wilfred Castillo, a Milford Police Department employee who was charged in a civil action in 2015 with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Milford, Connecticut, alleges that Castillo received numerous calls about a man carrying a red gas can and was present in one of the parking lots at the mall. According to the complaint, Castillo told the defendant that he had been advised several times before that he was not permitted to be on mall property and that he would have to leave the property. The complaint further alleges that the defendant told Castillo that he knew he was being banned from the property and would be arrested the next time he was found there. Castillo allegedly replied that he did not know that the property was being policed by an off-duty officer, and that the officer had instructed Castillo to check the property's boundaries. The SEC alleges that, based on Castillo's testimony, the defendant was not prohibited from entering or remaining on the mall property for the remainder of the day, but rather had to be restrained from entering the property by a security staff member.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Castillo on September 14, 2016.  On October 28, 2016, the jury found Castillo guilty of criminal trespass in the first degree.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the court also issued an order suspending Castillo from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  Castillo agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to comply with the entry-of-an-intent-to-permit provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and requires him to provide a copy of the Advisers' Rules of Practice. The court also granted Castillo the right to reapply for a jury trial in the future without prejudice to the issues raised in the Complaint. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit, and Amy S. Cotter of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Connecticut State Attorney General's Office."
