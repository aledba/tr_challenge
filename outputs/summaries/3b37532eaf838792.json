  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a New York City man who was charged with a sex offender-related felony.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, in 1989, Nelson D. Moore, then a resident of the Bronx, Virginia, committed a felony that required him to register under the federal Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry Act (SORA).  The complaint alleges that Moore committed the felony because his half-sister was harassing him about drugs.  According to the complaint, Moore was \"hearing voices telling him to kill people.\"  Moore allegedly replied, \"I was having a bad day.\"  In a parallel action, the Virginia Attorney General's Office today announced that Moore has agreed to settle the SEC's charges against him.  Moore has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. Moore has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to be prohibited from participating in the securities industry.  In addition, Moore agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from violating the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a)(1) and (3) and 5(c) and the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b)(2)(A) and Rule 13b2-3 thereunder. The settlement, which is subject to court approval, reserves the issue of whether Moore is a \"sex offender\" and whether he is required to register as such under Section 9.1-902 of the Virginia Department of Corrections. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Virginia Office of Inspector General in this matter."
