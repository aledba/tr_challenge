  "summary": "On March 10, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a final judgment against Amerimex Drilling I, Ltd., a Texas-based drilling company, and its former owner, J.C. Burchett, in a related action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Pecos County, Texas, alleges that, in the course and scope of its business, AmerimeX Drilling, Inc. and its then-director, Billy Peden, violated the right to control the details of the work performed by the drilling crew.  According to the complaint, the company was not liable for the injuries suffered by the crew members or for the loss of their lives.  Instead, the complaint alleges that the company failed to consider whether the injured crew member was acting within the scope of his or her duties while driving the crew to and from the drilling site.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against the company.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Mayes and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Fort Worth Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Department of Insurance, and the Texas Office of Inspector General in this matter."
