  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered final judgments against Elio Motors, Inc., a Louisiana-based manufacturer and dealer, for violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that Elio violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that it violated the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) and (g) and of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").

In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New Orleans today announced parallel criminal charges against the company.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the Commission has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $5,000 per day, for a period of 51 months, or a little over four years, for violations of the anti-fraud provision of Section 964(A)(1) and Rule 972(B).
