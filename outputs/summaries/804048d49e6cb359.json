  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a Chicago man who was convicted of two counts of attempted first degree murder for his role in the October 2013 double murder of Xazavier Little and Edward Little.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the defendant and ordered him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Chicago, the defendant told the court that he was a member of the Maniac Latin Disciples street gang, and that he knew several other people in the gang who were also members of the gang.  In addition, the court found that the defendant had a history of drug use and had been convicted of multiple felony counts of first-degree murder.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the defendants did not have any prior criminal convictions, and the judge imposed a mandatory minimum sentence of 57 years, or up to natural life, for each of the defendants.   In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against one of the alleged perpetrators of the double murder, Edward Little, who was later sentenced to prison for a total of 61 years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the Defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, pay a civil penalty of $1 million, and be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. \u00c2\u00a0The court also granted the defendant's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations and ordered the defendant to pay disgorgement of $2,655, which is equal to the amount of his already-arrested criminal conviction.  On December 6, 2013, a federal district judge in Chicago issued an order suspending the mandatory minimum sentences imposed on certain defendants for two years, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $100,000, respectively, for the same conduct.  This order also prohibits the defendant from associating with any person who is a convicted felon with a prior conviction for a felony, and bars him from participating in any form of criminal activity, including serving a prison term of five years or more.  Additionally, the order prohibits the defendants from using the internet to disseminate or sell any information concerning their criminal history, including through social media, without being registered as a lawyer or a registered representative."
