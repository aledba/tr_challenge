  "summary": "On November 12, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a defendant in a case brought by the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, in March 2011, mother, a 16-year-old dependent of the court, sought jurisdiction over her son, J.F., because she had been subjected to sexual abuse as a child by her stepfather and, as a result, had a history of using marijuana.  According to the complaint, the court found jurisdiction because of mother's mental condition, declared her to be a dependent, and ordered her to remain in the home of her father.  The complaint further alleges that mother continued to struggle with her supervision of JF, despite repeated requests from the court to terminate jurisdiction.  In addition, the complaint alleges that she had difficulty with her sleep, nap times, and toilet training, and that she frequently cursed in front of J. F. when she needed to check the child's sleep.  Finally, the SEC alleges that the defendant, who was previously incarcerated for a similar conduct, had an extensive history of drug use and had been barred from participating in parenting classes.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public school.  On November 13, 2011, a federal district court in Manhattan entered an order against the defendant that permanently restrains jurisdiction over the child.  As part of the order, the judge granted the defendant's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered the defendant to return to custody, and issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the children's care.  A hearing for the receiver was scheduled for December 21, 2011.  Following the court's order against mother, the case was reviewed by a staff member, including a social worker, and was supervised by a licensed attorney.  After the hearing was conducted, the jury deliberated on the merits of the case and found that mother was competent to consent to the termination of jurisdiction without prejudice to the relief sought by the court in the case.   The court granted the mother's motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered a conduct-based injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws, and imposed a $25,000 civil penalty.
