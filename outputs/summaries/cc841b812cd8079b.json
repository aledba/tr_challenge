  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against Borton Petrini LLP, a California-based attorney firm, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Providence, R.I., on July 11, 2016, the court found that, in connection with the assignment of a legal malpractice claim to a third party, the SEC lacked the authority to determine whether the assignment was appropriate.  The court also ruled that, contrary to the representations offered in the complaint, the assignment is not required by the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, on July 13, 2017, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges against Petrini for his role in the alleged scheme.  On August 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the losses incurred by the defendants in the earlier litigation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Petrini consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $147,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Petrini also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of five years.  As a result of the court's order imposing the asset freeze and ordering Petrini to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay a $2,500,000 civil penalty.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Justice in this matter."
