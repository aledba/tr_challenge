  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama today entered a final judgment in favor of a shareholder's motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against the defendants.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, alleges that, in 2009, Jenny Neese incorporated BAN, an Alabama-based company that provided diet and other nutrition-related services, incorporated 4tdd as a separate entity, and hired Martin & Associates Consulting Company, LLC as a vehicle to loan BAN a total of $457,062.54 over a period from July 2012 to August 2014. The complaint alleges that Neese failed to make a sufficient demand to BAN's board of directors for the loan, promising to repay the loan within six months, and failed to comply with the mandatory repurchase provision of Rule 23.1. The SEC also alleges that Martin and MACC breached the fiduciary duty of BAN by failing to timely approve the loan. In addition, the SEC alleges that Hale failed to adequately disclose to the board that she was a shareholder at the time of the loan decision, when she had been induced to reject a stock-purchase offer based on a claim she had made in the complaint that BAN had failed to find financing for BAN. The court also found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the SEC is entitled to a preliminary injunction against Hale and her companies from violating the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(2) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The defendants have also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of New York today announced criminal charges against Hale.  On November 17, 2014, a federal district court in Mobile, Alabama entered a judgment against Neese, ordering her to disgorge her ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay a civil penalty of $1.2 million. The judgment also ordered Hale to pay a $1,500 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The settlements are subject"
