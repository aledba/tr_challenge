  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Dallas man accused of illegally accessing child pornography on his computer.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, alleges that, on August 30, 2016, Hugh Michael Glenn, a registered sex offender with a prior federal conviction for transporting and shipping child pornography, failed to show that he had access to the images on his hard drive.  According to the complaint, Glenn, who lives in Arizona, accessed the internet through Chatstep, an anonymous online chat platform, and learned that someone with the username \"TexPerv\" had uploaded an image of a prepubescent male exposed in a lewd and lascivious manner to its site on August 1, 2016.  Glenn alleges that while Glenn's computer was in Government custody, the computer \"instantly rebooted,\" which triggered the installation of the Windows update and defrag program, resulting in at least ten gigabytes of data in the unallocated space of Glenn\u2019s computer. The complaint also alleges that Glenn failed to disclose to the FBI that he was downloading and selling child pornography and that Lehman had failed to timely remove the images from the hard drive before the FBI took custody of the computer. Finally, the complaint alleges that the FBI failed to provide Glenn with sufficient corroborating evidence to support his motion to dismiss the charges.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California today entered a final judgment against Glenn that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgment also orders Glenn to pay disgorgement of $1,865, which is equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  On September 14, 2016 the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Glenn, ordering Glenn to surrender his computer, and ordering him to appear before the SEC as a witness in a parallel criminal case. The court also ordered Glenn to comply with the entry of a court order requiring him to show cause and effect, including a copy of the court order, that he has complied with the requirements of the federal securities laws, including the right to a fair and impartial jury, and that the court will determine the amount and severity of any civil penalty imposed by the court upon Glenn. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Dallas Police Department, the FBI, and the Texas State Attorney General's Office."
