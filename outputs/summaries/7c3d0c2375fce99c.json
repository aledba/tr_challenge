  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of JMS Air Conditioning and Appliance, Inc. (JMS) against the District of Columbia for failing to timely respond to a request for a substitution hearing.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, alleges that, in May 2016, the District Of Columbia issued a temporary restraining order preventing JMS from conducting any substitution hearing, including without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, that JMS had failed to perform the boiler work required under Section 4107 of the Contracting and Contracting Licensing Act of 1940.  According to the SEC's order, JMS failed to respond to JMS\u2019s requests for a timely response to its substitution request.  In a parallel action, on June 5, 2017, the U.C. District of San Diego entered a partial judgment against JMS, finding that it had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Act and ordering JMS to submit a substitution request in the amount of $8.2 million.  JMS has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2,500, and a $1,500 civil penalty.  On June 6, 2018, the court granted JMS's motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered it to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court on June 7, 2018.  It also ordered the District to provide an accounting of the amount and nature of the alleged violations in the submittal of the orders, which were issued by the court in a separate administrative proceeding.  Without admitting or denied the SEC\u2019S allegations, JM consented to a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the federal, state, and local securities laws, and from participating in any future solicitation of bids for a public construction project.   The court also issued an order suspending JMS for five years, ordering it to comply with the requirements of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the district attorney to issue an order appointing a receiver for JMS in violation of the above-mentioned provisions, ordering the receiver to provide timely and accurate information about the work performed by JMS.  Finally, the order requires that the receiver receive written and oral testimony from the receiver. "
