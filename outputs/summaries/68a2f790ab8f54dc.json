  "summary": "On January 29, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of a New York-based company and its former director of marketing.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, from at least March 2016 through July 2016, New York City-based firm First Accounting Property Services, LLC (First Accounting), employed New York resident Alexandra Cimino Winner to provide marketing services in New York. According to the complaint, she was repeatedly told that she \"did not need to come to New York\" to provide \"sparkle\" services. The complaint further alleges that her immediate supervisor, Ryan Baker, engaged in a series of discriminatory actions, including, among other things, refusing to reimburse her for business-related travel expenses. The SEC alleges that Mr. Kohn, who was then First Accounting's Vice President of Asset and Quality Service, also engaged in the same conduct.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Winner on January 29.  On February 13, 2020, the Court granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the company to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, First Accounting agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay disgorgement of $2,253,078, plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a $100,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-CV-6670, No. 10-3, at\u00c2\u00a011:30 a.m. EST on February 26, 2020.  An SEC order appointing a receiver to oversee the investigation of this matter requires the court to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to determine that a defendant has reasonable reasonable cause to believe that he or she has reasonable reason to believe he/she has reasonable cause of believing that the complaint is true.  A hearing for the receiver is scheduled for May 24, 2020 at 10:30am EST.   The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Ms. Gibson. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Office of Financial Regulation."
