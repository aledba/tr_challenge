  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment in favor of the Baldwins' motion for summary judgment against the defendants.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Tampa, Florida, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants were not entitled to a homestead exemption for their residential property for tax year 2015 because they did not maintain the subject property as their permanent residence until six months into the year for which they were claiming the exemption.

The order also requires the defendants not to violate the federal registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The court also ordered the property appraiser to conduct an examination to determine whether the property is worth acquiring and whether it qualifies as a \"permanent residence.\"  In a parallel action, the Florida Secretary of State's Office today announced that it had obtained an order appointing a receiver to oversee the acquisition, construction, and operation of the property.
