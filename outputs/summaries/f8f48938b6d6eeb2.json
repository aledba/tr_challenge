  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the school district that denied F.M. a Special Education Education Program (IEP).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, in 2014, Mill Creek Elementary School in Madison, Alabama, failed to adequately evaluate a student with a learning disability.  The complaint alleges that the school board did not adequately consider the student's potential for impairment when evaluating her eligibility for the IEP.  According to the complaint, Ms. Waddail, a school board member, and Ms. Davis, an assistant principal at Mill Creek, raised the issue of whether an IEP should be adequately evaluated.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The court granted the defendants' requests for a temporary restraining order, an accounting, and an order appointing a hearing officer to determine the appropriate amount of remediation and other relief to be provided by the school.  On May 4, 2015, the Honorable Joseph F. F. Mascianica, Judge of the New York District Court, entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from future violations of the federal and state securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of $1,078, and orders the school to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and imposes a $75,000 officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alabama Department of Education, and the Alabama Office of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services."
