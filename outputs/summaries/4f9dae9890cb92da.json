  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in a civil injunctive action brought by a New York City resident who was injured in a car accident.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that, as applied to natural persons, the federal securities laws that govern New York and New Jersey require nonresident citizens to post security for costs in the United States.  According to the complaint, the SEC's judgment, which was entered on May 24, 2016, permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $500.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating these provisions.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 25, 2018, the Court granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the amount and amount of any civil penalties to be imposed by the court upon the nonresident.  As part of the settlement, the court agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal and state securities laws, and to the imposition of a $500 civil penalty.  A hearing on May 26, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Marc Blau of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau and Ms. Mascianica. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Department of Justice's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA) in this matter.
