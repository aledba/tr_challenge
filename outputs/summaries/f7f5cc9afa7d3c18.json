  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska today entered a final judgment against a former physical therapy assistant for failing to timely report an injury he sustained while assisting a patient in a wheelchair.  The court found that Michael Bauer failed to give the required notice of an injury to Genesis Healthcare Group, a Nebraska-based physical therapy company, as required by the federal workers' compensation law.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in Omaha, Nebraska, on September 15, 2017, Bauer was employed by Genesis as a director of rehabilitation and as a physical therapist assistant. On that date, he allegedly suffered a \"sharp pain\" and a \"sudden pop\" in his right shoulder, which he described as a \"burning kind of numbness\" that went down his arm. The court also ruled that Bauer did not report the injury as soon as practicable, and that he was entitled to a new \"fixed time\" for reporting the injury.  In a parallel action, on October 24, 2018, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges against Bauer. The SEC's complaint charges Bauer with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Bauer consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his legal fees. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On October 26, 2019, the court issued a temporary restraining order against Bauer and ordered him to return to work on October 1, 2019. The order also requires him to provide a copy of the complaint to Genesis, which will be filed with the court upon motion of the court.
