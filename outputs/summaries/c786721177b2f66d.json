  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Minnesota today entered a final judgment in favor of the Olsons in a civil forfeiture case.  The court entered the final judgment on the merits of the case against Megan and Helen Olson.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Megan Olson, a registered owner of a Lexus automobile, and her mother, Helen Olson, were charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 169A.63 of the federal securities laws. The complaint alleges that, in violation of these provisions, Megan was deprived of her right to a pre-deprivation hearing, a hearing, or a post-seizure hearing, and that Helen was unable to obtain a hearing on her claim. The court also found that, contrary to the representations made in the complaint, Megan had no interest in purchasing the Lexus and had no reasonable basis to justify a delay in obtaining a hearing. In addition, the complaint further alleges that Helen had no basis or standing to present a defense in the case. The SEC's final judgment against Megan Olson permanently enjoins her from violating these provisions and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $8,850, which is equal to the amount of her disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The final judgment also prohibits Helen from participating in any pre-judgment hearing related to the forfeiture of a vehicle.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against Megan.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Paul G.
