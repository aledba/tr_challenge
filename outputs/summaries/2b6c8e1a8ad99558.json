  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado today entered a final judgment against defendant William Scott Pettigrew, Jr., finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, Colorado, alleges that, in 2013, the Denver Police Department arrested a seventeen-year-old woman for soliciting for child prostitution, pandering of a child, and tampering with a witness or victim.  According to the complaint, the arrest and seizure of the woman\u2019s phone resulted in a search warrant issued without a warrant. The complaint further alleges that the officer only learned the physical description of the phone during the search, and that this information influenced the decision to seek the search warrant.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, however, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The court also granted the defendant the right to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Central District of New York today announced that it filed criminal charges against the defendant, charging him with violations of Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1. The SEC is continuing its investigation into the matter. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Amy S. Cotter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Colorado Office of the Attorney General."
