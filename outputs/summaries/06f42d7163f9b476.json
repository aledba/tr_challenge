  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered final judgments in a civil action brought by a Montana man who claimed that a non-resident father was the biological father of B.H. (Child) who was born in Montana in early 2016.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Utah on February 8, 2016, M.S.'s father, C.S., filed a paternity action in Utah in January 2016, claiming that a man other than Father (\"Purported Father\") was the father of the child.  The complaint further alleges that the court had jurisdiction to terminate Father\u2019s parental rights when the father filed a petition for adoption in Utah, despite the fact that the father had not resided in Utah at the time of the paternity action.  In a parallel action, on February 9, 2017, a federal district court in Montana issued an order suspending Father from participating in the adoption proceedings.   The SEC alleges that this order violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The court also ordered the parties to file a memorandum addressing whether the UCCJEA had jurisdiction under the adoption provisions of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Salt Lake Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Division of Human Services, the Utah Attorney General's Office, and the Utah Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
