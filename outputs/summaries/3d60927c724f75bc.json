  "summary": "On March 5, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia entered a final judgment against Comcast Cable Communications, Inc., a now-defunct Georgia-based telecommunications company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, from March 5 through August 2017, a representative for the defendant telecommunications company made a \"hard pull\" of the plaintiff's consumer report during the March 2019 call, damaging his credit score.  The complaint further alleges that the complaint was filed in violation of the arbitration provision in the 2016 Service Agreement, which requires parties to arbitrate disputes arising out of or related to a contract or transaction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and requires him to submit a personal injury claim to arbitration.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against the defendant for his role in the alleged scheme.  On March 6, 2020, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Comcast, charging the defendant with violating Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Joseph T. McLaughlin and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Georgia Department of Insurance, and the Georgia Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the Department of Justice today announced that it has obtained an order appointing an independent receiver to determine whether to issue an order requiring the receiver to comply with the terms of an arbitration agreement.   The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Cyber Unit, under the supervision of Eric R. Werner."
