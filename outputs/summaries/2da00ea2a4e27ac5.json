  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Colorado announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against Colorado Secretary of State Scott Gessler for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, Colorado, alleges that Gessler violated the federal securities laws by using millions of dollars of state funds for personal or political purposes, including to travel to Florida to attend an election law seminar hosted by the National Lawyers Association and thereafter attend the Republican National Convention.  According to the complaint, Gessler also used $1,278.90 from his discretionary fund account as reimbursement, without submitting documentation of mileage or other expenses incurred.  Gessler has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting, without admitting or denying the allegations, to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million, and orders Gessler to pay an officer and director bar and a penny-per-day officer bar.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the Colorado Attorney General's Office issued an order suspending Gessler from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and ordering him to provide an accounting of the amount of his discretionary funds spent.  On August 24, the SEC filed a complaint against Gessler, charging him with violating the federal anti-fraud laws, including Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  A hearing on August 26, 2017, was scheduled for 5:30 p.m. Eastern. The hearing was delayed by an hour because the SEC requested a temporary restraining order, an accounting, and an order appointing an independent investigator to review Gessler's conduct. The court granted the SEC request for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval, and ordered Gessler and his co-defendants to comply with the court's order. Gessler consented to entry of an order permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged sections of the state securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future. The order also prohibits Gessler or his companies from violating any of the above-mentioned provisions of the Colorado securities laws. In addition, the order imposes a $100,000 civil penalty on Gessler. The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael R. Ritter and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be led by"
