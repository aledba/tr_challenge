  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a California resident who filed a civil injunctive action against his former employer for defrauding his homeowners association.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Yu Ping Liu filed an application to the Homeowners Association of Rancho Palos Verdes (HOA) seeking to have the HOA enforce its tree-trimming covenant.  According to the complaint, Liu, who lives in the community, claimed that he was entitled to the right to cut down trees on his neighbor\u2019s lot, and that he had attempted to resolve the property dispute by submitting an application under Section 425.16(e)(4).  The complaint alleges that Liu failed to show a reasonable probability of success on his quiet title claim.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against Liu, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 5b-5 thereunder, and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Liu consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes civil penalties against him.  Liu also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly and easily identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In addition, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the California Office of the Homeowner Assessor (OIEA) in this matter."
