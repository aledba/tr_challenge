  "summary": "The Kansas Department of Revenue (KDOR) suspended Kelly Casper's driving privileges based on her arrest and refusal to take a blood alcohol test. The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas, alleges that Casper violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, in a parallel action, the Kansas Attorney General's Office (AGO) issued a temporary restraining order suspending Casper from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, and sale of any type of driving test, including field sobriety tests, which are designed to detect the presence of alcohol on a person's breath. The court also found that, contrary to the AGO's findings, Casper failed to comply with the requirements of the federal securities laws, including the prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures, and the requirement for an officer to perform a preliminary breath test. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court also ruled that the officer had reasonable grounds to believe Casper was operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and had reasonable cause to place her under arrest. Casper agreed to the court's order and agreed to a permanent injunction, to be suspended for five years, and to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC charged a Kansas City, Kansas Police Department officer with acting as an unregistered broker of securities in connection with the issuance of the suspension order. The officer was Steven Thornton, who was supervising the investigation.  According to the SEC's order, the officer who conducted the investigation was not authorized to conduct a PBT and, instead, relied on the subjective evaluation of the evidence presented to him by Casper.  He was questioned briefly about whether she had had \"some odor\" of alcohol emanating from her person and, for the purpose of evaluating the results of the investigation, he did not ask her whether her breath was \"strong\" or \"a little argumentative.\"  The court ultimately ruled that, based on the facts presented to the district court, that there was no reasonable basis for Thornton to suspend her license and that he had reasonable reason to believe that she was driving while impaired. The Court of Appeals also held that, as a result of the administrative action, Thornton was not required to perform any of the tests that the court ordered him to do, that he was not entitled to a reasonable basis to determine whether a person had passed the \"reasonable grounds\" test that the agency required him to perform at the time of the stop."
