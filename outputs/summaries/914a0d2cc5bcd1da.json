  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against DHL Express, Inc., DHL Worldwide Express, and American Trucking Assn. (collectively DHL).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that DHL violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint also alleges that, in violation of Section 13(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, DHL overcharged for services that did not travel by air or motor carriers.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the Deregulation Act and the Authorization Act of 1994 preempted DHL's preemption under Section 5 of the Exchange Act.

DHL agreed to settle the SEC's action by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating these provisions, ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $500,000, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty.

Hanan also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay civil penalties of $50,000 and a $25,000 bar.
