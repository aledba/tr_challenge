  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment against a New Jersey man charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) and violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  The court's order against Pedro C. Grabowski, who pled guilty in the municipal court in Newark, New Jersey on March 10, 2016, ordered him to serve a total of 180 days in jail, with the option of serving the remainder of his sentence on weekends.  According to the SEC's order, Grabowski agreed to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  The final judgment also prohibits Grabowski from participating in any work release program or participating in an inpatient rehabilitation program.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey announced criminal charges against Grabowski.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Jersey, charges Grabowski with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 10(d) and 13d-1 of the securities laws, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's judgment, the defendant consented to a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and a temporary restraining order against further violations of Section 5(b).  The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release Release Order No. 513-16, 355 N.J. Super. at 516, 908 A.2d 736.  Separately, the court issued an order requiring Grabowski to surrender his passport, which he has not yet done, and ordering him to comply with the court order requiring him to surrender and serve the rest of his prison sentence.  On August 26, 2017, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the New Jersey Court of Appeals entered a judgment that permanently restrains the bars on Grabowski's and Sansone's prior convictions.  Sansone also agreed to pay civil penalties of $150,000 and $75,000, respectively, for each DWI conviction and for leaving the scene of an accident, and $100,000 for each felony conviction. The court also ordered that Grabowski be barred from serving any jail-related sentence and that Sansone pay a $50,000 civil penalty."
