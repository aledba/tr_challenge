  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Shelly Materials, Inc., an Ohio-based company that entered into a mineral-rights lease in 2015 for an approximately 225-acre horse farm property in Streetsboro, Ohio.  The court of common pleas issued its final judgment on the merits of Shelly's application for a conditional-use permit.  According to the court's order, Shelly filed an application to amend the city's zoning code to remove surface mining as a conditional use in all districts where it was permitted, including in a rural-residential district.  In its judgment, the court found that Shelly violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the court had improperly focused on the expert's sales data for particular houses, as opposed to his opinion that surface mining would have no adverse effect on property values for the community as a whole.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the Court of Common Pleas also found that the Commission violated Section 13(b)(5) and 13(a)(2) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 thereunder and Rule 13a-3 thereunder.  It also ruled that the commission violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder (\"Advisers Advisers\").  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action and obtained a temporary restraining order and an order freezing the assets of the company and prohibiting them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, sale, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply as an officer, director, or officer of a public agency in the future. The SEC's complaint charges Shelly with violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act and Rule 12b-20, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  On May 17, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Western District of Pennsylvania granted the SEC's request for an emergency asset freeze and ordered Shelly to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty, which is subject to court approval. The court also ordered that the SEC file an application with the SEC for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 13 of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, Section 10"
