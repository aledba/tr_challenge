  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a New York City-based healthcare provider for her alleged role in a long-running discrimination case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, from at least 2009 through 2014, Ruth Duarte, a bilingual clinician at the David Casella Children's Services program in the Bronx, was subjected to verbal and physical abuse by her supervisor, Edgardo Quinones, who was also a member of the staff.  Duarte allegedly told Quinones that he would \"put your thing on\" if he could hear her, and that she \"would cry at night because she was going to have a nervous breakdown.\"  The complaint further alleges that Quinones allegedly told Duarte that she would \u201cput her thing on\u201d if she could hear him, but she did not.  As alleged in the complaint, Duarte continued to hear Quinones's remarks despite having no evidence of his or her impairment.  In addition, the complaint alleges that after Duarte complained to the hospital about her hearing impairment, Quinones continued to threaten her with physical and mental harm.  Finally, the SEC alleges that Duarte consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $125,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the Court also ordered Duarte to pay $750,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and ordered her to return her allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, to be deemed satisfied by the amount of her compensation, and to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $75,000, respectively.  On the same day, the court issued a temporary restraining order against Quinones and ordered him to return to work on a later date.  According to the court's order, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 598 (Aug. 23, 2014).  The U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Duarte.   The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Health and Human Services. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
