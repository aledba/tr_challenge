  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a custody case against a neurosurgeon who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Idaho Falls, charges that Brandon and his attorney, Robert A. McNaught, engaged in a pattern of bad mouthing and limiting Brandon\u2019s contact with the children.  According to the complaint, before trial, the magistrate court allowed Brandon to perform a parenting time evaluation on behalf of his son, but did not allow him to participate in the evaluation.  Instead, the complaint alleges, Brandon consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $105,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Brandi and McNaught agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the charged sections of the securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Brandi.  On May 30, 2019, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Brandon from further violations of these charged provisions, ordered Brandi to comply with the court order, and ordered McNaught to cooperate with the SEC in its investigation of the matter.  Brandi agreed to the appointment of a neutral expert, and agreed to participate as an expert witness in the case.  After the hearing on May 31, 2019 the court issued an order granting the SEC an emergency asset freeze and ordering a hearing to determine whether or not to proceed with the case against Brandon.   The court also granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations, and for a hearing on June 5, 2019. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Idaho Department of Health and Human Services, and the Idaho Office of Child and Family Education and Advocacy."
