  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in federal court against the Department of Education for failing to provide timely and timely disclosure of alleged violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York City, alleges that the Education Department failed to comply with certain of the requirements of the federal securities laws, including the disclosure rule that requires institutions to disclose adverse actions taken by state or accrediting agencies for certain of their programs.  According to the complaint, the Department also failed to disclose to its members that certain of these actions were related to the Department's actions in issuing the Disclosure Rule.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as a result of the delay, the plaintiffs were unable to obtain the required disclosures, including information about whether their programs meet state licensing and certification requirements.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Action Alliance of Senior Citizens v. City of Chico, 524 F.3d, 935 S.Ct. 1377, and Action Alliance v. State Farm Bureau, 527 F.2d, 1087. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, the U.N. Office of Education, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the United States Postal Inspection Service (OIEA)."
