  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Alvis Holley, a former officer of the Chicago Police Department who was convicted of attempted first-degree murder and sentenced to two consecutive 50-year terms of imprisonment.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, on December 1, 2011, Mr. Holley was charged with attempting to murder two officers in an alley behind the 4100 block of West Wilcox Street in Chicago.  According to the complaint, the defendants were in plain clothes, patrolling the city's west side together in an unmarked police vehicle when they noticed a possible hand-to-hand narcotics transaction between two officers.  As alleged, the officers were armed with a.22-caliber handgun and were attempting to defend themselves when the two men grabbed their arm and shot at them.  In a judgment that permanently enjoins Holley from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Holley consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil penalty of $50,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5/8-4(c)(1)(A).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Illinois Division of Criminal Investigations. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois State Attorney General's Office, and the Illinois Department of Justice in this matter."
