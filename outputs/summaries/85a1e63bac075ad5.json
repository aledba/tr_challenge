  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against former prison officer Rantavious Anderson on his claims of First Amendment retaliation.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that, in 2014, Anderson conducted a random patdown search of a prison dormitory where Carter was incarcerated. According to the complaint, Carter filed a grievance against Anderson for squeezing his buttocks in a sexually inappropriate manner during the patdowns. The complaint also alleges that Anderson had previously filed a complaint against him for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC alleges that the defendants failed to adequately evaluate Carter\u2019s need for counsel when they filed the complaint.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Carter failed to disclose to the jury that he was uncomfortable being searched because he had filed the grievance on his own behalf and that he had a good faith basis for filing the grievance.  As a result, the court denied the defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial.  On October 14, 2016, the SEC issued a judgment against Anderson, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $160,000, ordering that he be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public prison, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against him. The court also ordered that he pay a $50,000 penalty, which is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  Carter also agreed to be enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the SEC's order, and to the appointment of an appellate counsel.
