  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon today entered a final judgment in favor of an Oregon-based school district that has agreed to a total ban on the use of Native American mascots in education.  The court entered the final judgment on consent against the school district.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Portland, Oregon, on July 1, 2016, the Oregon Board of Education (ORB) issued an order requiring school districts to enter into an agreement with a federally recognized Native American tribe that would permit the school to use a mascot that represents, is associated with or is significant to the tribe entering into the agreement. The order also required that the tribe enter into a written agreement with the governing body of that tribe, which is subject to strict scrutiny to determine whether it is appropriate for a mascot to be used by a public school.  In addition, the order requires that any school district with a Native American mascot enter into agreements with a tribe that includes a tribe in which the mascot would be associated with a significant stakeholder in determining whether a tribe was appropriate to use the mascot.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the ORB has consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the district attorney to issue an order imposing a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal and state laws. The court also granted the tribe's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits it from issuing or selling any security or other emergency relief.  On August 2, 2017, the court entered final judgments against the tribe that issued the order, ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and imposing an officer-and-director bar. The district attorney's order also prohibits the issuance of any other order requiring the tribe to sign an agreement that imposes a burden on Native American students. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Reece. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Oregon Department of Education, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Oregon Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov\u00c2\u00a0Securities and Exchange"
