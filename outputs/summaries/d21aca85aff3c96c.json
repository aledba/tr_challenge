  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado today entered a final judgment in favor of Park Meadows Motors, LLC (Park Meadows), a Colorado-based automobile dealership, against GM, Alpine Motors, Inc. (Alpine), and the Executive Director of the Colorado Department of Revenue (Delegate) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13-80-111 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.  The court also found that the remedial revival statute does not apply to all claims for relief.  According to the SEC's complaint, Park Meadows filed its complaint in September 2017, less than 90 days after the Delegate's order was issued, and filed its new complaint within ninety days after she had previously dismissed it for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  As alleged in the complaint, this is not a sufficient basis for a successful revival of a previously filed complaint.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Park Meadows was fully aware of the contractual implications of GM&rsquo;s approval of the relocation of another dealership into what Park Meadows asserts is its territory, and that it sought a court-ordered injunction, a temporary restraining order, a cease-and-desist order, and an injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's judgment, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits, and requires Park Meadows to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  On November 2, 2018, the Honorable William D. Ferguson of the Denver District Court issued an order suspending Park Meadows from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney. The court's order also temporarily suspended Park Meadows\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval. The SEC\u2019s complaint charges Park Meadows with violations of Sections 12-6-120, 13-1-1, and 13-2-2 of the Dealer Act of 1940. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, an injunction, and the return of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest. The case is being handled by Eric R. Braunstein of the SEC Enforcement Division, and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by David A. Kasper."
