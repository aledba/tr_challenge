  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland today entered a final judgment against a former paramedic who claimed that he developed osteoarthritis in his right knee.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order halting the litigation.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Maryland on April 19, 2017, Michael J. Quinlan of Baltimore, MD, claimed that, while working as a paramedic, he developed menisci tears in his left knee. The complaint alleges that, as a result of his work, he experienced pain and stiffness in his knee and developed post-traumatic stress syndrome.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for Maryland today announced criminal charges against Quinlan.  On April 24, 2017 the court granted certiorari to the motion for a jury trial in which the court found that, based on the evidence presented at trial, Quinlan was liable to be compensated for his injury.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Mr. Quinnlan consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $2,082.16, prejudgment interest of $1,038.20, and a civil penalty of $100,000.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by David A. Cohen and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Baltimore Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Cohen. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U of S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Maryland Office of Inspector General in this matter."
