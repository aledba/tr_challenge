  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against United of Omaha Life Insurance Company (United), a Michigan-based life insurance company, and its joint owners and beneficiaries.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, in 2001, Sherman Kay bought a $2 million life-insurance policy from United, asserting that the policy had lapsed because the December 2008 and January 2009 premiums had not been paid before Dr. Kay's death.  According to the complaint, the policy's terms required United to do three things: first, submit a written application signed by the owner and the insured, and second, provide 30 days' notice prior to the termination of the policy.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, United has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $2,000,000.  United has also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 50(b).  The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United and Claymore agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction, which would bar them from future actions related to the breach-of-contract provision of the federal securities laws.  On May 24, 2019, the court granted United's motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered it to comply with the court's order, which requires the court to determine whether to grant a preliminary injunction, impose a conduct-based injunction, and issue an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver. The court also ordered the receiver to provide a copy of any termination notice that United failed to send to the receiver before the receiver received the termination notice.   The court granted the receiver's request for an emergency court order and issued an order suspending the receiver from further violations of the securities laws, ordering him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest thereon, and ordering a hearing on May 26, 2019 to determine the appropriate amount of relief. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Michigan and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
