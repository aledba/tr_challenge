  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Eric McGinnis, a convicted felon who was sentenced to 96 months imprisonment for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 922(g)(8) of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on July 28, 2017, in federal court in Grand Prairie, Texas, Judge Timothy M. Kerstetter issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order and requiring McGlynnis to surrender his AR-15 rifle.  The SEC alleges that the order, which was issued by a Dallas County court on August 31, 2015, imposes a \"substantial, narrowly tailored\" restriction on the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to keep and bear arms.

The court granted the SEC request for an emergency asset freeze and ordered a hearing on August 24, 2018. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Mr. Kerndetter and Ms. Thrash. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by David A. Cohen and Eric R. Werner of the SEC Enforcement Division's Fort Worth Regional Office. The investigation was supervised by Scott A. Kasper and Antonia G. Gottschall of the Atlanta Regional Office, with assistance from Joseph G. Sansone of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The examination was conducted in the Office of the Chief of the Fort Worth Division of Criminal Investigation, with the assistance of Assistant Director of the Division of State's Office of Public Health. The examiners performed the exam. The results were: (1) There was insufficient evidence to support a conviction under the federal laws; (2) There"
