  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Lezette Milton, a Chicago resident, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, from at least June 2016 through at least March 2017, Milton violated the antitrust provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-3 thereunder, and that she was deprived of due process by failing to comply with certain of the court's orders.  According to the complaint, Milton was not informed of the charges against her and did not respond to requests for an explanation for why she should not be held in contempt.

Additionally, the court granted Milton the right to return her allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest in the amount of $2,953, which she received as a result of her actions in the earlier contempt proceedings, and ordered her to provide a copy of the amended complaint to a receiver for the purpose of obtaining a court order requiring her to sign it.  On May 24, 2017, a federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi entered a judgment against Milton, ordering her to disgorge $1,038,768, plus $100,000 in attorney fees and court costs, and appointing a receiver to determine whether to hold her in contempt of"
