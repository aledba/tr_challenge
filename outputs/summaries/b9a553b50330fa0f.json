  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California yesterday entered a preliminary injunction against a California-based company and its former chief operating officer in connection with a software upgrade project.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Corona, California, alleges that VitaVet Labs, Inc. (VitaVet) hired a computer software consultant to create custom-built software for its business, and the consultant delivered an unfinished version of the software and withheld the source code and technical specifications needed to finish the software.  According to the complaint, the consultant failed to deliver the software to the company and instead provided it with an incomplete, unreadable version.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay $30,000 in disgorgement, $80,000 prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their respective profits.  In addition, the court granted the defendants' requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar, and ordered the company to post a bond to cover any damages IDS might be owed under the contract, and to pay a $73,750 final payment less the late delivery penalties.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a separate case, the SEC charged Integrated Dynamic Solutions, Inc., a company owned and operated by the company, with violations of Section 5 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 5 by failing to comply with certain of the requirements of the Adviser Act, including requiring IDS to submit an affidavit stating that it had developed a \"work in progress\" with respect to the software it had commissioned from IDS, and that the company had failed to provide an \"adverse effect on the marketability of [the] home\" as to how the software would be used.  Specifically, the complaint alleged that IDS failed to submit a \"persuasive showing\" through the sworn declaration of its Chief Operating Officer that the software was inoperable and inadequate to show damage to the home"
