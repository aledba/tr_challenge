  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wyoming today entered a final judgment in favor of a Wyoming landowner who is seeking to have her property taken as part of a road expansion project.  According to the SEC's complaint, J. Michaela Byrnes, a resident of Wyoming, filed an inverse condemnation action in 2010 alleging that a Wyoming County Road and Bridge Department (WYDOT) improperly took part of her property for the purpose of constructing a public road.  The complaint alleges that Ms. Byrnes sought to establish the value of the property by claiming that the road was moved onto her property approximately 33 feet, resulting in what she asserted was an unconstitutional taking of a space 33 feet wide and 420 feet long.  She also alleged that her private driveways were blocked during construction and that permanent survey markers were littered on her property.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court agreed that the property was worth more than $320,000 and that she was entitled to compensation based on the preconstruction value.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Wyo. today announced criminal charges against her for her role in the alleged taking.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Denver Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Wyoming Department of Commerce, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the U. S. Attorney\u2019s Office for Wyoming and the Federal Office of Inspector General."
