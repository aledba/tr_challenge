  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a civil action against her for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Ridgefield, Connecticut, alleges that, on March 17, 2008, the court granted the defendant postjudgment interest on the Schwab account and ordered that the amount owed to the defendant be determined by the court at a later date. The court also issued a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from violating these provisions of the federal securities laws and orders her to disgorge her ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and pay a civil penalty of $1,902,890. The judgment also orders the defendant to pay a penalty of 4 percent, which is equal to the amount that the defendant has already paid in the amount of the alimony arrearage, and to be held in escrow by the real property attorney handling the sale of the property. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) of The Securities Act of 1933, and ordering her to pay disgorgement of $459,700, which she did not pay in full. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Connecticut today announced criminal charges against the defendant. The SEC is continuing its investigation into the alleged misconduct of the trial court. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Office of the Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Connecticut Department of Banking and Securities."
