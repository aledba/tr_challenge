  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former husband and wife who were jointly and severally separated during a five-year marriage.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, between March 8, 2016 and October 13, 2016, the defendants entered a judgment of dissolution without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  According to the complaint, the court found that the defendants had commingled their property, including real property, $8,000 in cash, and $3,000 of premarital property, and that husband had not rebutted the presumption of equal contribution as to the equity in the 8th Court House. The court also found that husband did not have a duty to maintain the property as a separate property and that he should share equally in determining the amount of equalizing judgment.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On November 2, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, charging the defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Separately, the complaint charges husband with violating Section 17(b)(5) of Securities Act Section 10b of the Exchange Act and Rule 12b-20 thereunder.  Without admitting or denied the SEC's allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer and sale of any security, investment, or other security that may be deemed appropriate for the purpose of securing the security of the security.  Additionally, the judgment orders the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $192,768, which is equal to the civil penalties imposed by the court on the defendants, and imposes a $75,000 civil penalty against each of the defendants for each of those violations. The judgment also orders the parties to pay civil penalties of $189,677, which includes $12,877 of each spouse's separate down payment of $44,068.08 that the court deemed \"just and proper\" in determining a just and proper division of marital property. The defendants agreed not to commingle their assets and finances during the two-year separation and to the payment of their civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval."
