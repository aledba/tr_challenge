  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas today entered a final judgment in favor of the University of Texas and Idalia Llorens Collection Agency, Inc., a Texas-based third-party debt collection agency.  According to the court's order, filed on August 6, 2019, the University filed a complaint in federal district court in Texas alleging that it improperly collected on behalf of a university in Puerto Rico by using a third party to collect on the university's student tuition.  The court found that the University violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1406(a) of the federal securities laws, and that it had no jurisdiction over the university.  In its order, the court also entered a temporary restraining order against the University from furthering its collection efforts in Texas.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the university consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amounts of $5,568.68 and $1,666.86, respectively.   The SEC's order also orders the University to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount the university has agreed to pay to settle the case. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay in the Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Dolan and Ms. Palmer. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Puerto Rico, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5-15-01257-CV, May 24, 2019.  On June 7, 2020, the Court granted the University's motion for a preliminary injunction, entered an order appointing a receiver, and appointed a receiver for the receiver. The court also granted the university an emergency asset freeze.

Kasper and Eric R. Werner of the Atlanta Regional Office, and was supervised by Jennifer C. Barry."
