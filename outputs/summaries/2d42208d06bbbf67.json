  "summary": "On June 14, 2004, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found liable for the death of a pedestrian who was hit by a car while attempting to cross the street outside a crosswalk.  The court found that the defendant was entitled to a specific instruction on causation, which the model jury charge on vehicular homicide requires.  According to the court's order, the defendant had expressly placed causation in issue when he lost control of his vehicle while driving at excessive speeds and failed to yield to oncoming vehicles.  As alleged in the complaint, however, defendant minimized his speeding and was able to avoid the impact of the collision.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against the defendant for the same conduct.  On June 16, 2013, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and a civil injunctive relief order against the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the court, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Birkenheier and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the New York Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Department of Transportation, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
