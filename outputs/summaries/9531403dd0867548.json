McCluskey for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Houston, alleges that McCloskey violated the federal due-process provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) and that he violated the pre-judgment provision of Section 841 of the Texas Health and Safety Code. The complaint also alleges that McLane violated her duty to provide for the safety and well-being of her fellow citizens by failing to comply with certain provisions of the federal law. Specifically, the complaint alleges that, in violation of Rule 841, McLane failed to enforce certain of those provisions, including requiring a payment of a certain amount in the amount of $1135.48 per month, and failing to enforce those provisions in a civil commitment proceeding. The court also denied the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction, which would have prohibited McLane from violating the federal securities laws, and ordered McLane to pay a civil penalty of $25,000. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.
