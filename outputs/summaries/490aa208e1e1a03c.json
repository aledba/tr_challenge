One of the men allegedly told one of the other men that he was a \"scrap.\"  The complaint further alleges that the defendants' statements were inadmissible because they did not have sufficient evidence to support their claims.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the Defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders them to pay civil penalties.

The defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and (c) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and to pay a $50,000 civil penalty in the amount of $75,000, which is equal to the amount that Defendants will be ordered to pay in civil penalties of $150,000 each.  Additionally, Defendants agreed to pay disgorgment of $25,000 and a $10,000 penalty, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.
