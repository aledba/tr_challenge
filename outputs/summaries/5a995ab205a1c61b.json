  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of South Dakota today entered a final judgment against Jonathan Packard, a former Sioux Falls Police Department officer who was convicted of second-degree rape and simple assault in 2015.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, Packard violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that Packard consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 17(a)(1) and 17(b)(3) of Securities Act Section 10b of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-1 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Packard also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Packard.  On September 27, 2017, the Honorable Amy C. Welshhans of the Court of Common Pleas entered a judgment permanently enjoining Packard from violating the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge $1,078 in prejudgment interests, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the court also ordered Packard to pay a $20,000 penalty, which he will pay in the amount of $100,000, which will be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Chicago Regional Office by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.
