  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against four individuals for their roles in a 2014 oil and gas pipeline fraud.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Louisiana, Oliver Liecht McMickens, a land representative for a Louisiana-based gas pipeline company, and his brother-in-law, Ricky Loren McMicken, raised the issue of whether Acadian should acquire a right-of-way servitude across their property in order to access the pipeline.  The complaint alleges that the defendants agreed to settle the timber damages claims without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In addition, the SEC alleges that Acadian agreed to pay $2,627.00 per acre for a servitude over their property, which would be the same as the servitude the company previously sought.  As alleged, however, this amount was far out of the range that the Defendants had sought, and Acadian did not consider the option of acquiring the property at the time it did not have access to the pipeline servitude.  Instead, the complaint alleges, the defendants sought to acquire the property by bush hogging it four to five times a year, trimming trees along the route, and keeping the path clear of fallen trees and limbs.  Acadian also sought a temporary servitude servitude from the city of Alexandria, which is located directly across the property from the property where the property is located.   The SEC's Complaint against the Defendants alleges that they violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Scott A. Sistler and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit in the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Kerls and Mr. Sristler. The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  Investors can also check the background of anyone selling investments with the SEC\u00c2\u00a0by using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana."
