  "summary": "On May 5, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia entered summary judgment against Dr. Funlola Aboderin, a board-certified pediatrician, and her husband, Dr. Diana Chalmeta, in a medical malpractice action brought by Michele Holt's mother.  According to the SEC's complaint, from 2006 to 2007, the defendant failed to adequately assess the severity of a newborn\u2019s respiratory distress and failed to transfer her to a higher level of care facility.  The SEC alleges that Dr. Abodein was not qualified to testify as an expert witness because she had never worked in a hospital without a NICU, and had never performed hands-on care to a baby requiring an airway.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in 2006, she was employed as a pediatrician/neonatologist assessing and treating newborns, including those with respiratory distress.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, when confronted by a physician at the University of Virginia Hospital who asked her about her qualifications to testify, she replied that she had no clinical practice in pediatrics or a related field of medicine, and that she did not know the standard of care required of pediatricians providing care for newborns in the NICU.  She also did not have experience regarding medical facilities without a hospital, both in regard to assessment and transfer, despite never having worked in one, through working with providers in lower-level facilities wishing to transfer infants to her hospital.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the SEC has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Additionally, the court has ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $25,000, and ordered the destruction of any evidence that may have been used to support or support the claims of the SEC in this matter.  On May 6, 2017, a federal district court in Alexandria, Virginia entered a judgment against the defendants, finding them liable for violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their ill health and pay civil penalties of $10,000 each, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against the other defendants.   The court also ordered the SEC to appoint an independent receiver to determine whether to issue an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver, and to provide an accounting of the amount of money lost in the receiver's misappropriation."
