  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a former attorney who was barred by the federal securities laws for defrauding clients.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Diego, alleges that, in 1997, Nancy F. Lee hired attorney William B. Hanley to represent her in certain civil litigation.  According to the complaint, after Attorney Hanley's services had been terminated, Lee sought a refund of attorney fees and unused expert witness fees.  Hanley allegedly refused to return the money belonging to Lee.  In a second amended complaint, Lee alleged that, on or about December 6, 2010, Hanley sent a cease-and-desist letter to Lee, claiming that all professional services were terminated when the settled litigation was dismissed.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Lee consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of $9,725 plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $10,000.  Lee also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to the appointment of a receiver of the company's securities.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."
