  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania today entered final judgments in favor of Carelink Community Support Services, Inc. (\"Carelink\") in a work-place personal injury action.  The court entered a final judgment on consent against Carelink, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, that it was liable for the December 20, 2014 attack on a Carelink employee while performing her job duties.  According to the court's order, Carelink agreed to pay $75,365.88 to settle all claims with respect to her rights to workers' compensation benefits for the attack, and to pay a civil penalty of $40,000.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services (WHA) today announced that it has entered into a settlement agreement with Carelink that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Carelink's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on August 2, 2016, alleges that, in the course and scope of her employment, the attack occurred while she was performing her work duties, and that the attack was not work-related. The complaint also alleges that Carelink consented to the entry of a consent judgment that permanently bars it from violations of the federal securities laws. The consent judgment also prohibits Carelink from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the Commission's investigation. The SEC's complaint charges Carelink with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\"). The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The court also granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
