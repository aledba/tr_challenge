  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Hawaii today entered final judgments in favor of the County of Hawai'i in a civil action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Honolulu, alleges that the Hawai\u2018i County of Hawaii (County) exceeded its authority under the federal and state constitutions when it amended the property tax code in 1978 to include wind turbines.  According to the complaint, the county had the power to determine the value of wind turbines in its real property tax assessments for the 2014, 2015 and 2016 tax years.  In addition, the complaint alleged that the County had the right to define \"real property\" when it had the authority to do so.  As alleged, however, the County did not have the ability to define \u201creal property.\u201d  The complaint further alleges that, as a result of the county\u2019s actions, it was unable to determine whether or not the counties had the capacity to define the term as part of a common property tax program.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Hawai\u2019i County consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the County from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the County to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.   The court also granted the County a temporary restraining order, which prohibits it from issuing or selling any security deposit in the name of a public company or entity, and from imposing a penny stock bar on the company.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge William J. Hannan of the U. S. District Judge's Office issued a final opinion against the County, ordering it to comply with the court's order.  Hannan also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a publicly-traded company for a period of five years, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, which will be determined by the court upon motion by the County.  Hanabusa agreed to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge $2,500,000 in prejudgment interests, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty.  Donnelly agreed to the settlement without admitting or abetting the County's violations.  He agreed to settle the case"
