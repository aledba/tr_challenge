  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against FedEx Corp. and its former manager in a civil injunctive action brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Belleville, Michigan, alleges that, from 2006 through 2011, FedEx and its then manager Todd Treman engaged in a pattern of misstatements and omissions in the company\u2019s internal policies and procedures. For example, according to the complaint, Hubbell was repeatedly disciplined for filing an EEOC complaint with the agency and was told to clock in and out at the same time as her fellow employees, even though she had not filed a complaint. In addition, the complaint alleges that when Hubbell complained to the agency, she was told that she was being singled out for adverse treatment because she had filed a lawsuit. The complaint further alleges that after she filed her complaint, the company and Treman agreed to settle the matter by agreeing to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $157,733.75 plus prejudgment interest of $1,038.95 and a civil penalty of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan today announced criminal charges against Hubbell. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, Eric R. Werner, and Amy C. Welshhans of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
