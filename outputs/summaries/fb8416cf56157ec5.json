  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against a Michigan-based family medicine practice and its owner and director for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on January 14, 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, through a contractor, notified Josephine C. Bello, M.D., of an overpayment in the amount of $1,000,844.00.  According to the complaint, Bello agreed to accept assignment of Medicare Part B payments and, in return, received direct and timely reimbursement from the federal government.  On August 12, 2016, the SEC issued an unfavorable redetermination decision to Bello's Medicare Receivables, which means she has not exhausted her administrative remedies.  In a parallel action, on September 14, 2018, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges against Bello.  Bello has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Wisconsin Department of Justice."
