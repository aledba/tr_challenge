  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Grayson Enterprises, Inc., a roofing company, and its former president, Edwin Gire, on charges of unlawfully harboring unauthorized aliens.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that Gire and Grayson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Gire falsely claimed that he and Grayson had received two massive roofing contracts from Gire in 2013 and 2014, and that the warehouse was used to house the workers.  Instead, the complaint alleges, as alleged, the warehouse had been used by Gire to house unauthorized aliens who had left because of Gire\u2019s illegal immigration policies.  Gire also falsely claimed to the SEC that he had not been harboring illegal aliens, despite having been told that he was.  In fact, the SEC alleges that neither Gire nor Grayson were harboring any illegal aliens and that neither of them were authorized to work in the United States.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties.  Grayson also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $3,500, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For additional information, see Litigation Release No. 1324a-1, No. 12(b)(2)(A), No. 17-cv-01221. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
