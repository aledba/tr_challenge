  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the residents of the Roxbury, New York-area home of Sigma Alpha Mu Fraternity, Inc. (formerly known as Delta Iota).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that the resident defendants, Steven B. Leake, Karl Smith, Corey Wilson, Kenneth M. Koperda and William K. Genewick, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint further alleges that Leake and Smith violated the duty to control the conduct of third persons on their property.  According to the complaint, the residents failed to establish that the defendants were responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the home and that they failed in their duty to keep the property in a safe and proper condition.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their ill-gotten gains.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a real estate investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about potential investment scams targeting investors in real estate development projects.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0In a separate administrative proceeding, the Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order halting the sale, purchase, offer and sale of any security deposit that may be obtained from a third party, including a broker-dealer, brokerage firm, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, and real estate agent.   The court's order freezes the assets of the residents and prohibits them from soliciting investments in any third-party, including from raising the issue of liability for a person who has been injured as a result of his or her own intoxication.  For example, the court granted a preliminary injunction against future violations and ordered the residents to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for May 24, 2018. "
