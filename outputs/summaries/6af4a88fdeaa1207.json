  "summary": "On January 14, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a preliminary injunction against Chobani, Inc. (\u201cChobani\u201d) and its parent company, Dannon, LLC (Dannon), in an action brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  The Commission's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that Chibani falsely claimed that its yogurt product had 33% less sugar than Dannon's, and that Dannon was in the process of correcting a problem with its packaging.  According to the complaint, however, the Commission found no evidence to support this assertion, and instead relied on the testimony of a former Dannon marketing executive who testified that the company had \"worked hard to position Danimals as a safe and nutritious snack that parents can give to their children.\"  In addition, the complaint alleges that, based on the Commission's findings, ChobANI has failed to adequately disclose to its customers that it has reduced the sugar content in its yogurt and dairy products by 33% or more, and failed to inform its customers about the difference between the two products' relative sugar content.  Dannon has also failed to disclose to consumers that it had substantially reduced the amount of sugar in its yogurts, despite repeated requests by the Commission to do so.  In a parallel action, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Dannon for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions and civil penalties against both defendants.  On January 21, 2020, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court in Manhattan seeking a temporary restraining order, an accounting, and an injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, as well as an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the New York office by John Rymas of the Market Abuse Unit, and the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis and Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Mascianica. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
