  "summary": "On August 27, 2018, the Ohio Court of Common Pleas entered a final judgment against John Pease Moore III, III, M.D., that permanently revoked his license to practice medicine and surgery in the state of Ohio.  According to the court's order, Moore consented to the entry of a judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in his brief, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio on October 19, 2016.  The court found that Moore violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Moore had the opportunity to contest the Board's decision to revoke his license.  In addition, the court ruled that Dr. Moore was not entitled to a hearing officer's recommendation that he be permanently suspended from practicing medicine or surgery for two years.  Moore also consented not to be permitted to participate in the examination of potential witnesses in the case.  As alleged in the court order, however, Moore had previously waived any reasonable effort to raise the issue of whether he should have been permitted to plead before the board for a full record of his conduct and reasons for acting as he did based on what the hearing officer found to be privileged investigatory material. The court also found that, contrary to the board's finding, Moore was improperly excluded as an investigatory and privileged witness in the criminal case investigation.  On August 26, 2018 the Ohio Administrative Office issued an order requiring the court to consider whether to revoke Moore's medical license. The order also requires the court appoint a receiver to determine whether to issue an order permanently suspending Moore's license and requiring him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his civil penalty.  Additionally, the order requires the receiver to provide a copy of the final judgment to the receiver, which is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221.   The Court's order also prohibits the receiver from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any medical device without the prior authorization of the receiver.  It also orders that the receiver not to violate the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 10(d) the federal securities laws, including the reporting, examination, and reporting requirements of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) the medical board's Rules of Practice and Rules 206(3) and 206 (4) thereunder. The receiver also has the right to respond to the disciplinary hearing"
