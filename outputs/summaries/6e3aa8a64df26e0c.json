  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against Amazon.com, Inc., a Pennsylvania-based online retailer, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 402(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 402(b) thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia on January 12, 2015, Amazon, through its subsidiary, The Furry Gang, sold a dog collar to Heather Oberdorf, a Pennsylvania resident, who purchased the collar directly from a third-party vendor. The complaint alleges that Amazon failed to provide adequate warnings regarding the use of the dog collar and failed to adequately protect the customer.  The complaint further alleges that, in a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Amazon for its role as a \"seller\" in connection with this conduct.  In its order, the court found that Amazon is not subject to strict product liability under the federal securities laws because it does not have the right to impose strict liability on third-parties. The court also held that Amazon has the right in its sole discretion to suspend, prohibit, or remov[e] any sales of its products, and to pay Amazon and its Affiliates amounts in the amount of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Amazon agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,500, and a $10 million civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert on the subject of this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Retail Strategy Task Force encourages investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Pennsylvania on January 24, 2016, alleging that Amazon violated the federal anti-fraud and securities laws by failing to provide timely and accurate information about the safety of products sold by third parties. The SEC also charged Amazon with violating the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0Securities Act of 1940.
