  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment in favor of a Kentucky man who was sentenced to thirty years in prison for his role in an April 2016 shooting death.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Lexington, Kentucky, alleges that the court improperly entered a temporary restraining order on April 13, 2016, preventing the release of a videotaped confession by a Kentucky State Police detective who had been previously convicted of the same crime.  According to the complaint, Easterling, who was a known drug dealer who usually kept a handgun in a safe for protection, told the detective that he had shot Cole in order to protect him from unreasonable searches and seizures. The complaint alleges that Easterling then had the idea to steal the gun from the detective and used it to make a statement to his mother and grandfather, who were also present at the time of the alleged shooting.  Easterling also alleges that a family member overheard Easterling making the allegedly incriminating statement.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Easterling.  On May 24, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendant, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, an officer-and-officer bar, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 5b2-1 thereunder, as well as an order to prohibit the introduction of gruesome photographs from the inside of a police car.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, and imposes a $25,000 bar on Easterling and his family. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 527 (2014).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Kentucky Division of Criminal Investigations.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Criminal Investigations, with assistance from John Rymas, and was supervised by Scott A. Thompson, Assistant Director of the Division of Enforcement. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson.  A hearing will be conducted on May 25, 2018."
