  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment against Mississippi State Farm Insurance Company v. Lorine Mitchell, a Waterford, Mississippi resident who was previously certified as a class of homeowners in Mississippi. Mitchell alleges that, in calculating her compensation for her breach of contract claim, she misstated the true value of the property and thereby paid less than she was owed. According to the SEC's complaint, Mitchell and her insurer, State Farm, agreed to settle the case by agreeing to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b)(5) thereunder, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $646.19. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit in the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Mascianica. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Mississippi Department of Insurance, and the Mississippi Secretary of State's Office in this matter.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Insurance Regulation has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily identify whether they are registered professionals.  In a related matter, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against Mitchell.  On May 24, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Mitchell, charging her with violations of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Insurance Enforcement.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, including in the case of Mitchell. The investigation was supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The matter of Mitchell and the SEC litigation is being handled by Scott A. Burt and supervised by Amy C. McKinley of the Atlanta Regional Office, under the supervision of Joseph G. Sansone. The Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint Bulletin\u00c2\u00a0on the subject of liability for Mitchell and State Farm violations. The Commission has issued\u00c2\u00a0a\u00c2\u00a0Notice\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0the Commission has\u00c2\u00a0issued\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor\u00c2\u00a0advisory\u00c2\u00a0of\u00c2\u00a0compliance\u00c2\u00a0with\u00c2\u00a0requirements\u00c2\u00a0for\u00c2\u00a0institutions"
