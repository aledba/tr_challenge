  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found not guilty of a federal felony for a mail fraud and transporting stolen funds in foreign commerce.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Madison, Wisconsin on August 2, 2011, Mhammad Abu-Shawish, a former steelworker in one of Carnegie's mills who was released from prison after serving twenty years of a life sentence for a murder he did not commit.  The complaint alleges that the defendants sought and received a grant from the city of Milwaukee to create a plan for revitalizing a street in Milwaukee.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the grant came from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, which in turn paid for the project.  In a parallel action, the federal district court in New York yesterday denied the defendants\u2019 motion for a certificate of innocence.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Finally, the court granted the defendants a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from further violating the federal securities laws, and ordered them to pay civil penalties of $75,000 and $100,000, respectively, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion by the parties involved in the case.  For additional information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Wisconsin Department of Justice, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
