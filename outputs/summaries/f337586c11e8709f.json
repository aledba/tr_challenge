  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was charged with a felony for his role in the death of a high school student.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Hammond, Indiana, alleges that, on August 21, 2017, then-fifteen-year-old O.E.W. told his de facto father, Andy Ruiz, that he planned to go to a local park to purchase marijuana from his girlfriend, Lucia Gonzales.  According to the complaint, however, the complaint alleges that the defendant did not buy marijuana and instead used a crow bar and a kitchen knife to stab Gonzales, which he claimed to have received during a long, drawn-out, and aggressive interrogation.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant had previously purchased marijuana from Gonzales and, on at least one occasion, had engaged in a fight at the park.  In a parallel action, the Indiana Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed criminal charges against the defendant, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, the Defendant has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requires him to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations.  On August 24, 2018, the court granted a motion to suppress from appearing before the SEC the right to a jury to determine whether a defendant has a right to participate in a court-ordered investigation of a serious criminal matter, and orders the defendant to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Separately, the Court granted the defendant's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from associating with any person with whom he has a history of criminal conduct, and from participating in a public offering of a penny stock or offering to purchase or sell any penny stock at any time. The court also granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction against future securities laws violations, which includes the issuance of a cease-and-desist order, and a permanent injunction against further violations of Section 15(b)(5) of Exchange Act Section 17(e) and Rule 15e-3 thereunder. The judge granted the motion for summary judgment on September 10, 2018."
