  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, alleges that defendant Manuel Baca Jr. (Fidel) was embittered against his father Fidel and wanted him dead.  According to the complaint, Baca told the emergency responder that he was going to burn the place down and that he had a pickaxe stuck in his chest.  Baca allegedly used the pickaxe to stab Fidel's father, Fidel, in the chest and abdomen.  In addition, the complaint alleges that when confronted by a neighbor who knew Fidel, Fidel replied, \u201cDon\u2019t touch the fucking dog.\u201d  The complaint further alleges that, after Fidel was incapacitated and defenseless, he continued to lash out at the neighbor, who confronted him and asked him to stop.  As alleged in the complaint:  The court found that, based on the evidence presented to the court, that defendant was acting crazy and wanted to end his life.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, $20,000 in disgorgement, and $1,500 in prejudgment interest, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Finally, the court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order against Baca and ordered him to be held in a secure, locked facility until a hearing on the merits of the case has been established.  On January 8, 2016, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Rymas of the New Mexico Court of Appeals issued an order suspending Baca from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, including securities in exchange for an officer-and-director bar, a penny stock bar, and a bar against him from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney.  A hearing scheduled for February 5, 2020, was not conducted by the SEC, and the court found Baca liable for a total of five felony counts of murder, including one count of attempted murder, and ordered that he be held for life without the right to reapply after a five-year period of confinement.   The Court also ordered that Baca be restrained from associating with any person with a criminal"
