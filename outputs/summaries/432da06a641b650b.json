  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Department of Health and Human Services (DHS) in a case that was investigated by the New York office of the SEC.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, while in prison, T was placed in the care of his sister, Ivanez, who gave T methadone to help him sleep.  According to the complaint, T's sister, who was also incarcerated at the time, was available to care for T while father was in prison.  As alleged, however, because T had been in the grandmother\u2019s care for only the few months that he was incarcerated, father was unable to take care of T while he was in custody.  In its judgment, the court found that, as to father, he had failed to prove a threat of harm to T, and that he had not violated the terms of his probation, including having no contact with mother, which presents a risk of serious loss or injury to a child.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, T consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a conduct-based injunctive relief.  On the same day, the SEC filed an emergency action in which it obtained a temporary restraining order against T, ordering him to surrender his passport, and imposing a $1,000 civil penalty against him.  At the same time, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against T.  A. L. Gibson, Joseph G. Sansone, and Eric R. Werner of the Philadelphia Regional Office in connection with the case.  Gibson has agreed to a settlement that is subject to court approval. Gibson agreed to be enjoined from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against further violations of Section 5(b)(5) and 17a-3 of the\u00c2\u00a0Securities Act of 1940 and Rule\u00c2\u00a010b2-1 thereunder.  It is also seeking a court order requiring the issuance of an order appointing a receiver to oversee the children in the custody of the federal district court.   In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California today announced parallel criminal charges"
