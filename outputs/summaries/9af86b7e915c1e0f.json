  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Adam Lewis, a Mississippi resident, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed on June 30, 2016, alleges that Adam and Karen were married in 1989 and were granted an irreconcilable differences divorce in 2002.  According to the complaint, shortly after their divorce, Adam began dating Steven Dobel, an attorney who was also a defendant in the case.  Adam and Dobel had vacationed together on many occasions and even bought a vacation home together in 2010 or 2011; however, according to Adam, Dobel and Karen did not live together as a couple and did not spend the night at each other's homes.  As set forth in the SEC's Complaint, Adam failed to meet his burden of proof by failing to show that he was financially able to support Karen or vice versa.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Adam.  On June 29, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Adam, finding him liable for violating Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10 of the Exchange Act and Rule10b-4 thereunder, and ordering him to pay $15,000 per month as \"permanent periodic alimony\" in the amount of $27,870.99, which is to be expected and hardly sufficient to justify the denial of half of the attorney's fees that Adam requested.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Adam consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to repay $13,698.49 of his alimony, which he has already repaid to Karen.  Karen also agreed to be barred from appearing before the SEC as a witness in a case involving a defendant who had been convicted of a felony and sentenced to prison for a total of 17 years.   The court also granted Karen's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, including securities in the securities industry, as well as the right to reapply as an officer or director of a public company after five years of serving as a judge.  This order also prohibits Karen from making material and unanticipated changes to her relationship with a defendant, including by consenting to the issuance of a court order prohibiting her from reapplying to the bar"
