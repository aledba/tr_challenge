  "summary": "On January 11, 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the California Department of Education.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Fresno, California, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants sought a court-ordered injunction to prevent them from violating the federal securities laws, and the court granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  In a parallel action, the California Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against one of the defendants for his role in a similar action.  On January 13, 2011, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Sacramento, charging the defendants with violations of the anti-fraud provision of section 1021.5.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of this provision, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $382,382.50, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $243,817. The court also ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties of $250,000 each, $100,000 for each defendant, and $50,000 to be distributed among the defendants as part of a settlement that is subject to court approval.  As part of the settlement, the Commissions agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating these provisions and to be barred from future securities law enforcement activities. The SEC also agreed to pay a $75,000 civil penalty and to the imposition of a $25,000 bar.  To settle the case, defendants agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining them from further violations of these provisions. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  A hearing is scheduled for May 24, 2012.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2018."
