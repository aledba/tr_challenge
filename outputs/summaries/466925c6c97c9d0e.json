  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Travis Lee Doyle, who was convicted of aggravated assault in 2010.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that Doyle used a series of lies to convince a jury that he acted in self-defense.  According to the complaint, Doyle told a group of friends that he was going to a party with his girlfriend, Girlfriend, when he confronted Girlfriend about her alleged involvement in a domestic violence incident.  Doyle allegedly told the friends that Girlfriend was a nice guy and a \"nonviolent kind of guy.\"  The complaint further alleges that he told Girlfriend that he had been threatened by multiple attackers and that he \"cold clocked\" Girlfriend after she confronted him about it.  Girlfriend and her cousin also allegedly confronted Doyle, telling him that he did not want to fight Girlfriend because Girlfriend's testimony was \"patently false\" and \u201cuncorroborated.\u201d  Doyle also allegedly told one of his friends that Victim was \"jumped\" as soon as he hit her.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Utah today announced criminal charges against Doyle, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  On January 2, 2019, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the U.N. Division of Justice granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Doyle and ordered him to return to the country of his birth.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the SEC, Doyle consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. White and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Salt Lake Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Office of Criminal Investigations, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Utah Department of Justice in this matter."
