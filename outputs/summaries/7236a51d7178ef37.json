  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Logan Vanderhoef, who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, on May 3, 2016, defendant Maurice Dixon, a part-time reserve officer with the City of Maryville, Tennessee, unlawfully held three teenagers at gunpoint for approximately two minutes during a routine traffic stop.  According to the complaint, the defendants had no criminal history, cooperated throughout the ordeal, posed no immediate threat to the officers or others, and did not resist arrest or attempt to flee.  In a parallel action, on July 26, 2011, a federal district court in Memphis, Tenn., entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Dixon from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay $500,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Dixon consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged sections of the securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interests, and ordering him not to participate in the offering of a penny stock or to pay a $1,000 civil penalty in the amount of $2,500, which he will pay in a civil proceeding.  On July 24, 2018, the court entered a temporary restraining order against Dixon and ordered him to comply with the court's order.  To learn more about qualified immunity, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Nov. 24, 2016).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit."
