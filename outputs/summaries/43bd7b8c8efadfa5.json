  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Robert H. Lawrence, Jr., an attorney for Long Island Sound Programs, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Connecticut, alleges that, in 2012, Lawrence filed an application for a permit to construct a residential dock and pier in Greenwich Cove, Connecticut. The complaint alleges that the Commission improperly concluded that the proposed dock would degrade the visual quality of the cove's vistas and view points. The Commission's final judgment, which was issued on January 20, 2015, found that Lawrence had not demonstrated that he was classically aggrieved by the Commission's decision, and instead relied on past department practices and permits to determine whether he was entitled to a reasonable response.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Connecticut today announced criminal charges against Lawrence.  According to the SEC's order, Lawrence has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal, state, and municipal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Lawrence also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years, and to a five-year officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Lawrence agreed to a permanent injunction, to be suspended from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a five year officer and director bar. The court also granted Lawrence the right to reapply for a hearing in the future.  On July 24, 2016, the court granted Lawrence's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered him to return to Connecticut, and appointed a receiver to oversee the application. The receiver will be appointed by the court upon motion of the SEC. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, and the Connecticut Office of the Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
