  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment in favor of the Juvenile Office finding that, in violation of Section 559.05 of the federal securities laws, B.O. was not entitled to a fair disposition after he admitted to being beyond parental control and violating compulsory school attendance laws.  The court also found that, on January 1, 2019, the court had ample evidence to determine an appropriate disposition based on the evidence presented at trial regarding B.o.'s probation violations and property damage, as well as the Social Investigation Summary filed by the Department of Juvenile Services.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Daviess County, Missouri, on December 31, 2018, Judge Larry Adams, Jr. granted the Juvenil Office's motion for a dispositional hearing and, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, permanently enjoined the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(3) of Exchange Act Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against B. O. for his role in the alleged scheme.  On March 4, 2020, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Jason Turley of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry."
