  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois on June 19, 2019, entered a final judgment against the defendants in a related administrative proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to comply with the court's order, and instead submitted a series of documents to the court that were not privileged.  For example, the complaint alleges that, in the first round of litigation, defendants submitted a privilege log, which included a valuation chart, brief, and analysis of properties subject to purchase options.  In the second round, defendants allegedly provided the court with a copy of the privilege log.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $20,000.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from destroying documents, including documents that were prepared in the ordinary course of business, or prepared in anticipation of litigation.   The court also ordered the defendants to pay a $25,000 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against one of the defendants.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John H. Welshhans and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Office of Inspector General, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00a0The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. The litigation will be led by Ms. Holtz and Mr. Wyshans. The case has been supervised by Assistant Chief of the Chicago Division of Criminal Justice."
