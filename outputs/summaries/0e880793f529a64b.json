  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central Valley District of California today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a civil case against the school district.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Michael Cronin, who was employed as a teacher in 2012, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that the defendant failed to comply with a court order ordering him to pay a civil penalty of double damages and attorney fees. The SEC alleges that Cronin was not entitled to a statutory hearing on both discharge and nonrenewal, and that the District failed to timely provide Cronin with a timely opportunity to respond to the court\u2019s order. In addition, the court found Cronin liable for double damages for nonpayment of wages and for reasonable attorney fees and prejudgment interest. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Cronin.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, Cronin filed a declaratory action, alleging that the trial court erred by failing to provide a timely response to the District's motion for contempt and for failing to pay Cronin his wages and benefits. The court ultimately held Cronin in contempt and ordered Cronin to pay $100,000 in disgorgement and $1,500 in prejudgment and civil penalties. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws. The judgment also prohibits the District from issuing a civil injunctive order, imposing a penny stock bar, and imposing an officer-and-director bar. The district also agreed to pay civil penalties in the amount of $2,500, which is equal to the amount owed to Cronin by the court. The final judgment also requires the court to determine whether to suspend or revoke Cronin's employment and pay the civil penalty to a party who successfully recovers wages from the alleged misconduct. The Court also ordered the District to pay an officer and director bar and a $50,000 civil penalty. The District has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the securities laws, ordering the payment of civil penalties, and ordering the appointment of an independent hearing officer. The settlements are subject to Court approval. The litigation will be led by Scott A. Basinger and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry."
