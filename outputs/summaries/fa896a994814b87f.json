  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Shawn Clark, a former Douglas County, Georgia officer, on consent for failing to object to the use of deadly force in the defense of habitation.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that Clark shot and killed Antonio Ellison on November 14, 2015.  According to the complaint, Ellison confronted Clark after the shooting and confronted him at the top of the driveway, telling him that he had been set up and set up because he feared Ellison\u2019s family would retaliate against him.  As alleged, Ellison then confronted Clark with a gun in the cup holder between the two front seats, and confronted Clark about the gun.  After Clark confronted Ellison, Ellison and McClure confronted Clark, and Clark fired a single shot at Ellison, striking him in the head.  Ellison died from his injuries.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against Clark.  On May 24, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against Clark from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Clark consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a conduct-based injunction.  Clark also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2019.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Clark, charging him with violating Section 17-a-1 of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-3 thereunder and with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations, a return of the stolen property, and the imposition of civil penalties.  To settle the SEC case, Clark has agreed to a $20,000 penalty and to be permanently barred from the securities industry. "
