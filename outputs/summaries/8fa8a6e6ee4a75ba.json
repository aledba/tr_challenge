  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Green Haven Correctional Facility, Inc., a Green Haven, New York prison, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Green Haven was inadequately represented in its provision of health care services.  According to the complaint, in September 1979, Louis Milburn, then an incarcerated Green Haven inmate, filed a pro se complaint with 13 other co-plaintiffs in the Milburn class alleging that the facility had inadequate medical care and that, even if some unconstitutional conditions persisted, the judgment was not the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of any constitutional right.  In response, the district court issued a judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from violating Rule 60(b)(6) and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Irvin consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  Irvin also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to a five-year officer-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 539 (January 2018).  The complaint also names three other defendants who are currently in contempt of the court for violating Section 802 of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which requires defendants to show extraordinary circumstances to qualify for relief from a judgment obtained without due process, including whether they have standing to challenge the judgment, whether they could have objected to class counsel's decision to withdraw its decision to terminate the consent decree, and whether they had standing to file a civil injunctive action against the defendants.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Donnelly of the United States District Court in Manhattan granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered Irvin to comply with the court\u2019s order, and appointed a medical auditor to review the status of the Green Haven facility.  Donnelly agreed to the preliminary injunction and to the appointment of a permanent director of the prison.  Judge Donnelly also granted the class counsel and class counsel access to the records of the defendants, which includes records of disciplinary proceedings against defendants who were not named in the complaint.  He also appointed a receiver to assist the class"
