  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments in favor of Petroplex Pipe & Construction, Inc., a Midland, Texas-based oil and gas company, and Sam Hardcastle and Drake Feeney, a former pipe welders for Petroplex, in a civil injunctive action brought by the SEC.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, from at least February 2014 through January 2017, Petroplex and Hardcastle, through their companies Petroplex pipe welding services, were not required to demonstrate initiative when performing their work. According to the complaint, however, as a result of this conduct, the welders' year-end profits and losses did not depend on their ability to find other work. In addition, the complaint alleges, as alleged, that Hardcastle worked exclusively as a pipe welder, and that he paid for the work as required by the company. The complaint further alleges that Hobbs worked exclusively for the company, despite having been previously hired as a W-2 employee, and did not receive an employee handbook or uniforms. In fact, Hobbs testified that he did not participate in the work, but instead, took advantage of tax deductions to pay for his own meals and housing. The SEC also alleges that the defendants violated the anti-fraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its judgment, the court found that Petroplex violated the antifraud provision of Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 of the Exchange Act. The court also ordered Petroplex to pay $101,600 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of money owed to each of the defendants. The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about independent contractor status, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-0117 (January 2019).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case has been supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Department of Workforce Education and Advocacy."
