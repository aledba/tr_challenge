  "summary": "On September 6, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Union Pacific Railroad Company (\"Union Pacific\") for liability arising from a train derailment in Lawtell, Louisiana.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that on August 4, 2013, a train derailed, causing lube oil, dodecanol, and sodium hydroxide solution to spill from three of the derailed train cars onto the land and into a nearby drainage ditch.  According to the complaint, the derailment and its resulting chemical spill caused significant harm to dozens of residents, many of whom developed varying complaints of physical symptoms lasting for varying time periods.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Sheryl Bobb and her daughter, Alyiah Bobb, were at a family gathering when the train derailed and were confronted by some residents who live near their mother's house.  As alleged, the train's derailment caused the chemical substance to enter the drainage system and cause the residents' eyes to water and red eyes.   The complaint further alleges that the train driver, Martin Bobb Jr., was present at the event and did not notice the chemical spill when he smelled it.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's order, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar.  On October 20, 2017, the court issued a temporary restraining order against the defendants from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and ordered the defendants to return to their homes and pay civil penalties in the amount of $200,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Kelly Scribner and supervised by Marc Blau.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Orleans Office of Inspector General, and the Louisiana Department of Health and Human Services."
