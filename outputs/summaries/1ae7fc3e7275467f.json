  "summary": "On May 22, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of West Virginia entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was sentenced to ten to twenty-five years in prison for failing to update his sex offender registration.  The court found that the defendant violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to do so.  According to the court's order, the defendant failed to comply with the mandatory registration requirements for sex offenders.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for West Virginia announced criminal charges against Hoyle.  As alleged in the SEC's complaint, Hoyle was charged with two counts of second-and-third-degree sexual assault in the second degree, a felony for which he was previously convicted, and a third felony for failure to register as a sex offender.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Mr. Hoyle consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the federal registration requirements, imposes a mandatory ten-to-20-year prison sentence, and requires him to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  He also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David Hoyle and supervised by Spencer L. Bendell of the Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Virginia State Attorney General's Office, and the FBI. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and to identify whether their investments are being used for legitimate purposes."
