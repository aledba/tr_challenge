  "summary": "On January 20, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a default judgment against a California-based company and its founder for allegedly violating the registration provisions of the federal trademark laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Diego, California, Viet Tan-Vietnam Reform Party (Viet Tan) and Viet Nam Revolutionary Party (Vi\u00eat T\u00e2n) are trademarks of the Vietnamese-American political party Viet Tan.  The complaint alleges that the defendants used the Marks in connection with their political activities since 2004.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the Marks were not registered with the federal government, and the defendants did not use the Marks as a legitimate business or political product.  In addition, the complaint alleges, the defendants' use of the Marks was not consistent with their stated intent in selecting the Marks, and they did not represent to the public that they had a legal right to the Marks.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the California Department of Banking and Securities, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the California Office of Financial Regulation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling or selling investments using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0instant learning tools to identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related case, the SEC also issued an Investor Alert about the potential for fraud in the securities industry."
