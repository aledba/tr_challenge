  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment in favor of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (DOJFS) in an emergency action to liquidate certain of the entities that had been liquidated.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that, in August 2008, the Ohio Secretary of State's Office issued a determination that Employer's Choice was the only entity that met the statutory definition of employer pursuant to R.C. 4141.01(A)(1) and that it was the successor-in-interest to Alzey Enterprises I, Inc., Employers Risk, and the J Ross Companies.  According to the complaint, this finding violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Economic and Risk Analysis today announced that it has issued an\u00c2\u00a0order\u00c2\u00a0to determine whether an entity can be deemed to be a successor in interest under the federal employment compensation laws.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Cacaro and supervised by Scott Frost. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Ohio Office of Inspector General in this matter."
