  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a California-based transportation company and its former owner in an arbitration case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that on June 14, 2014, Express Messenger Systems, Inc., doing business as OnTrac, hired Jesus Fernando Gonzalez to sign an arbitration agreement that, in violation of generally applicable California contract law, imposes a mandatory arbitration clause on an independent contractor.  According to the complaint, the arbitration clause is procedurally and substantively unconscionable because it requires the parties to share the costs of arbitration with each other.  For example, the complaint alleges that, when arbitration is imposed on an employee as a condition of employment and there is no opportunity to negotiate, arbitration agreement is not possible.  In its judgment, the court found that, as a matter of law, the parties are entitled to the right to a hearing before the Labor Commissioner.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Gonzales and Luesch consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion by the SEC.  Gonzales also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the selection of an arbitrator based on his or her experience.  On May 31, 2017, the SEC filed an emergency action, seeking a temporary restraining order, an injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against Gonzales.  Among other things, the Court found that arbitration clauses in the arbitration agreement violate the federal securities laws, and that arbitration is not enforceable.  It also ordered arbitration on the basis of procedural and substantive violations of the contract, and to determine whether to impose a civil penalty or otherwise impose a penalty upon the arbitrator.  Separately, on July 28, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Los Angeles County District Court issued an order requiring arbitration to be conducted in a neutral manner, including in the absence of any evidence of procedural or substantive violations.  Sansone agreed to the appointment of a third arbitrator, which is subject to the court's approval. The court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a hearing on July 29, 2018 and a hearing scheduled for August 5, 2018.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted"
