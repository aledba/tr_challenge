  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment in favor of granting the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and other emergency relief.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., alleges that, from at least March 2017 through March 2018, Emerson Jones, a former supervisor at the Institute for International Economic Policy (IIEP), engaged in a pattern of misconduct that included verbal and physical abuse of multiple women, including Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 3.  According to the complaint, Jones allegedly told one of the women that he would \"never stick [his] dick into the pool of IIEP ever again.\"  The complaint further alleges that Jones allegedly encouraged the woman to \"get drunk\" and \"call [her] co-workers\" after she complained to her supervisor about his conduct.  In addition, the complaint alleges that on at least one occasion Jones allegedly asked Jane Doe 2 to come over to his apartment and asked her to \"call[s] his co-team leader [and] call[e] a friend and [call] his [new office crush].\"  The court's order, which was entered on March 13, 2018, permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The court also granted the defendants' request for an emergency restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and barring them from further association with any third-party law enforcement agency.  On May 24, 2019, the court entered a judgment against the defendants that permanently enjoined them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordered them to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and ordered Jones to be barred from the field of education for five years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating these provisions, ordering them to disgorge their illusory gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties of $150,000 and $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-cv-01-17 (January 24, 2018).  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Jones.  Among other things, the SEC today announced that it had obtained an emergency court order halting Jones's alleged misconduct.  It also announced that the SEC had issued an order suspending Jones from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney."
