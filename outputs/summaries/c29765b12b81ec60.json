  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the New York State Attorney General's Office.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Buffalo, N.Y., alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that they violated the due process provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Section 13(b)(5) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 12b-20 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to provide sufficient evidence to justify the retroactive application of the 2009 amendments.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants had no reasonable expectation that they would ever recoup their business investments through the receipt of tax credits.  As a result, defendants were prevented from reincorporating or transferring employees or assets among related entities in order to appear to have created new jobs or made new investments to maximize Program benefits.  Finally, the court found that the Defendants violated the pre-judgment provision of the federal securities laws, which requires a court to determine whether a defendant is entitled to a penny-per-share of a business's income with respect to the amount of a tax credit that the business has received.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, Defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the securities laws and ordering them to pay disgorgement of $1.6 million, prejudgment interest of $473,366, and a civil penalty of $500,000.  Defendants also agreed to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $75,000, respectively, for violations of Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The settlements are subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 1, 2008).  The case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, under the supervision of Eric R. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the State Corporation Commission in this matter."
