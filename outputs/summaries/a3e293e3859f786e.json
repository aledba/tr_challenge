  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (\"BMS\") for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 1871 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the name of the People of the State of California, BMS engaged in a course of illegal and fraudulent conduct aimed at doctors, health care providers, pharmacists, and insurance companies.  The complaint alleges that in carrying out this conduct, BMI targeted physicians, members of formulary committees, and sometimes their families, to be recipients of lavish gifts and other incentives, including tickets to sporting events and concerts, free rounds of golf, resort vacations, meals, and other such incentives, in order to induce physicians to prescribe BMS drugs and to reward them for doing so.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000.  BMS also agreed to pay a $20,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against BMI.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for March 29, 2011, for which the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."
