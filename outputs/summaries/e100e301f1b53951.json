  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against Anthony A. Keith, Jr., a convicted felon who was charged with possession of child pornography.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, alleges that, while Keith was employed as a campground's \"chuck wagon\" driver, he asked H.T. for her cellular phone number and asked her to send him pictures of her breasts and vagina through Snapchat.  According to the complaint, Keith replied that he would \"like to play with my [breasts] and vagina,\" and that, when he received a notification from Snapchat, he could still control what happened to the images in the brief interim before they were deleted by saving them to his phone and reducing them to the personal possession of the defendant.  In a parallel criminal action, Keith pleaded guilty to one count of felony child pornography and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Keith consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a conduct-based injunction.  On May 12, 2017, the court amended the first two counts of the charges to include attempted sexual misconduct with a minor as a level 5 felony, child solicitation with a level 6 felony, and aiding and abetting Keith's violations of Section 15(a)(1) of Exchange Act Section 17 (a)(2) and Rule 15a-3) and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars from serving as officers or directors of a public company.  Keith also agreed to be enjoined from associating with any person with whom he has a history of misconduct, and to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or promotion of any form of adult-based adult entertainment.    The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.
