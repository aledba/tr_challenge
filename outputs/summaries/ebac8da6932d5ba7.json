  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Colorado today entered final judgments in a case brought by the Denver District Attorney's Office against a convicted felon who was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.  According to the court's order, on July 1, 1990, the Colorado General Assembly amended sentencing statutes to provide for the resentencing of people, like Brooks, who were then serving mandatory LWOP sentences for class 1 felonies.  The court found that the amended sentencing scheme violated the Special Legislation Clause of the Colorado Constitution, which prohibits the imposition of mandatory minimum sentences.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court in Denver today entered a final judgment against Miller and Montgomery, finding that the 2014 sentencing legislation violated the federal securities laws, and imposing a mandatory minimum sentence of 30 years in prison.  On August 2, 2016, the U. S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Denver entered a judgment against the defendants, finding them liable for violating the federal antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The final judgment also permanently enjoins the defendants from future violations of the \"special legislation\" provision, and orders the court to determine whether to impose a penalty based on the severity of the alleged violations.  For example, the court has not yet issued a judgment imposing a penalty for a class 1 felony, and it has not issued an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver's receiver.  It also orders the receiver to appoint a receiver to determine if the receiver has any reasonable basis for determining whether the receiver is entitled to a penalty of life imprisonment with the possibility for parole after forty years.  As set forth in the court order, the receiver must be a person who has been convicted of a felony and sentenced to a minimum of thirty years of mandatory imprisonment.  Additionally, it requires that the receiver be a \"genuine\" person with a history of felony murder, and that he or she be eligible to receive a sentence in the range of thirty to fifty years. The court also has not imposed any mandatory minimum sentencing, and neither the receiver nor the receiver have"
