  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against San Jose Police Department officers Michael Santos and Anthony Vizzusi in a civil injunctive action brought by the District Attorney's Office.  The court entered a temporary restraining order on July 5, 2019, freezing the assets of the defendants and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Jose, S.D.C., on July 4, 2016, the defendants raised the issue of whether the officers were entitled to qualified immunity from excessive force when, in fact, they were not.  As alleged in the complaint, the officers' actions constituted excessive force because they did not see Nunez pointing the gun at officers.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the officers did not engage in any aggressive or aggressive conduct, and that they simply did not respond to the threat posed by the person they shot.  On July 6, 2017, the court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered the officers to return to the scene of the alleged shooting.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interests, pay civil penalties, and pay officer-and-director and officer-based injunctions in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the San Diego Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Enforcement's Cyber Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau and Ms. Mascianica. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Criminal Justice, and the California Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in this matter."
