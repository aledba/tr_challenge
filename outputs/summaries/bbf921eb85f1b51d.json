  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two officers for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Terrell Day, who was arrested on September 26, 2015, was unlawfully restrained by two officers who were not entitled to qualified immunity because they were not trained to consider an injury or condition when handcuffing an arrestee.  According to the complaint, Day complained of difficulty breathing during the chase and was prevented from conducting a full examination due to having his hands cuffed behind his back.  In addition, the complaint alleged that Day had a history of obesity and an underlying heart condition, and that the officers violated the right to be free from unreasonable force.  Day's death was the latest example of officers acting unreasonably in violation of the federal securities laws.  On May 18, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the officers, charging them with violating the right of a public official to have a right to a fair and just hearing.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the officers consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-officer bar against them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the judgment, and bars them from serving as officers or directors of any SEC-registered broker-dealer, municipal securities dealer, municipal association, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.   The court also denied the officers\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered the officers to comply with the court\u2019s order, which requires them to show cause and effect in the case where they are located.  Finally, the court issued a temporary restraining order against Day, ordering him to surrender his passport, and ordering the officer to provide a copy of his medical report to the court as well as an examination of his heart.  It also ordered the officer and the arresting officer to sign a joint statement of facts that is consistent with the First and Second Principles of the Federal securities laws, including that a reasonable officer cannot be expected to accommodate an injury that is not apparent or that otherwise has not been made known to him.  To determine whether the officer violated the First Principles, the Court ordered the arresting officers to provide an accounting of their actions.
