  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant charged with orchestrating a series of high-level gang-related murders in Central Islip, New York.  According to the court's order, filed on April 11, 2017, the defendant was charged in April 2017 with participating in the April 11 murders for La Mara Salvatrucha, a violent street gang also known as the MS-13.  The court found that, contrary to the government's representations that the defendant would be rehabilitated as a juvenile, he did not participate in the murders.  Instead, the court held that, based on the defendant's age at the time of the alleged crimes, he was unlikely to rehabilitate as an adult.  In a parallel action, on July 19, 2018, the United States Attorney's Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On July 21, 2018 the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order suspending the defendant from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, charges the defendant with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgements of $1,078.95 plus prejudgment interests in the amount of $2,077.95, a civil monetary penalty of $100,000, and bars from serving as an officer or director of a public school. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Goldsmith."
