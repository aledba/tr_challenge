  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon today entered a final judgment against a former resident of Corvallis, Oregon, who is charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on May 14, 1979, filed in federal district court in Oregon, Paul Conte and Bryn Thoms agreed to settle the case by agreeing to the entry of an order that permanently enjoins them from acting as an unregistered broker-dealer or party in a quasi-judicial land use decision.  Conte also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a $100 filing fee.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  In its order, the court also ordered that Conte, Thoms, and another resident of the same address, Olive Rossman, participate in the review of the Oakleigh Meadows development by filing a motion to intervene in the matter.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Conte has consented to entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordering him to pay $100,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his or her civil penalty.  On May 23, 2017, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the Federal District Court in Oregon granted the request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Conte to comply with the court's order.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Oregon Department of Commerce, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Oregon Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
