  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes and Kentucky Attorney General Patrick J. McCluskey in a related case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Lexington, Kentucky, alleges that Grimes violated the antifraud provisions of Section 170 of the federal income tax.  According to the complaint, Grimes and McClusky agreed that the federal district court for Kentucky should determine whether to impose a tax on the property of a public charity.  In its judgment, the court found that the exemption for public charities is not a property tax, but rather a tax upon the use of the property.  For example, the Court held that the use tax exemption for charitable institutions does not apply to property taxes, and that it is not subject to the same exemption as property taxes.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Grimes consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions, and orders her to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $99,000.   The court's order also prohibits Grimes from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any form of tax, and prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of any Kentucky-based charitable organization. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit, and is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter in the Atlanta Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kentucky Department of Revenue, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kentucky Office of Inspector General in this matter."
