  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in a related administrative proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that the Department violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1395 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that, in violation of the preclusion provision, the Secretary improperly used a different methodology to calculate the DSH additional payment.  According to the complaint, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) had previously issued an order requiring the Secretary to review the methodology used by the OIG.  OIG had also issued a similar order requiring OIG to review OIG\u2019s methodology.  In its order, the court found that OIG violated the preclusivity provisions of the federal securities laws, and barred the Secretary from using the same methodology in calculating the additional DSH payments.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, OIG consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the Department from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $100,000, $50,000 in disgorgement, and a $75,000 civil penalty. OIG also agreed to a judgment barring OIG from reviewing the methodology of its calculation of the additional payment, which is subject to court approval. The court also ruled that the Secretary violated the bar on judicial review in this case.  On May 1, 2016, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the Federal Bureau of Investigation entered an order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering the Department to conduct a review of OIG's methodology. The Court granted the order and ordered the investigation of the matter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Department of Insurance, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Florida, and the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation.  For further information, see Press Release No. 1395ww(r)(2)(A) and Order No. 12221 (D.C. Cir. 2018)."
