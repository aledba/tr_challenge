  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment in favor of Lindsey Patrick and Christian Patrick, who are charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Ann Arbor, Michigan, alleges that Lindsey Patrick was injured in a car accident on February 12, 2013. According to the complaint, Lindsey reported experiencing hearing loss and tinnitus immediately after the accident, and that she experienced hearing loss immediately following the accident. The complaint further alleges that she was told by an audiologist that the sound from the air bags deployed near her ear caused her to experience hearing loss.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the air bag explosion caused Lindsey's hearing loss, which was consistent with her other complaints.  Lindsey also testified that she had difficulty hearing during normal conversation unless she was concentrating on caring for her young baby.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Lindsey and Patrick consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws, order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and impose civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 27, 2010, the Honorable Kathleen M. Burns of the United States District Court in the Southern District of New York entered a judgment against the defendants, ordering them to disgorge their ill health and pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000. The court also granted the defendants the right to reapply for a hearing in the future without prejudice.   The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Hearing Education and Advocacy. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Department of Insurance, and the Michigan Office of Insurance Regulation."
