  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against defendant Justin Deandre Bass, Jr. and Jerome Fogg of Raleigh, North Carolina, that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Raleigh, N.C., alleges that, on the eve of trial, Bass and Fogg engaged in a verbal altercation, which escalated to the point that defendant shot Fogg in the face.  According to the complaint, Bass confronted Fogg and told him that he was, like Fogg, a member of the Piru Blood gang.  Fogg replied, without admitting or denying the allegations, that he had no duty to retreat before using defensive force.  Bass agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to a permanent injunction and to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 14(a)(2) and 14(c) and ordering him to repay the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for North Carolina announced criminal charges against Bass.  On May 17, 2018, the U. S. District Judge in Raleigh issued a temporary restraining order and ordered Bass to surrender his passport and return to North Carolina.  He also ordered Fogg to pay $1,500 in disgorgement, prejudgment interests, and a $100,000 civil penalty.  To settle the case, Bass will be required to show that he acted in self-defense and that he has a reasonable fear of imminent death or serious bodily harm to himself or the person he is trying to protect.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 589 (2017).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Criminal Division, and Amy C. McKinley, Assistant Director of the Division of Enforcement's Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the North Carolina State Attorney General's Office."
