  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Minnesota today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a paternity action brought by K.N. and J.N., alleging that they violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Minnesota, A.S., who was charged with concealing his father's identity from his family, signed a recognition of parentage (ROP) in which he stated that he was the biological father of a child and that he had \"an opportunity to be a part of the child's life in any way.\"  The complaint alleges that, in reality, the ROP did not apply to all of the parties involved in the action.  The court's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins the defendant from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court granted the defendant's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered a hearing on the matter.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged sections of the securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interests, and ordering a hearing to determine whether to proceed with the paternity action against him.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Amy C. Hershfang of the Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Gibson, and the case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Minnesota Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
