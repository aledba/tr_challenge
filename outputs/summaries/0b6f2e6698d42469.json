The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in El Paso on April 13, 2015, alleges that, beginning in 2000 or 2001, Monique Monique Aguilar complained to her supervisors and human resources personnel that she was being harassed by Manny Lucero, a former supervisor of the department's public works department. According to the complaint, Aguilar raised the matter with her supervisor, Norma Palacios, who was her supervisor at the time, and told her that Lucero was \"in over his head\" and \"in lieu of a woman.\" The complaint further alleges that Aguilar replied that she had \"forget the past, made amends with [Lucero] in lieu of [her] being [treated] with [sic] that she could not do the job of.\" Aguilar resigned her position on April 16, 2015.
