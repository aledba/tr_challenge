  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today granted summary judgment in favor of Williamson County, Tenn., and two other defendants for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Nashville, Tennessee, alleges that, from November 17 to December 19, 2013, J.H. was placed in solitary confinement in response to a complaint by his mother, Betty Harris, who alleged that he had become aggressive, destroyed property, and verbally assaulted her son. The complaint further alleges that the defendants failed to train and supervise J.h. and failed to provide adequate medical and mental health care.  According to the complaint, the defendants also failed to adequately train JH. and his mother.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Tennessee today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 22, 2017, the court granted the SEC's motion for summary judgment against Williamson County and McMahan, ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) and orders them to comply with the court's order. The court also granted the defendants the right to reapply for a hearing in the future on the merits of the case.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the three defendants, charging them with violating Section 15(a)(1) of Exchange Act Rule 10a-5 and Rule 15a-1 thereunder, and with violating Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The complaint also names as a relief defendant the Department of Justice's request for a temporary restraining order preventing the defendants from violating the federal securities laws (\"Securities Act\") as well as an order appointing a receiver to oversee the institution of a court order requiring the release of a convicted felon.  Finally, the complaint charges the defendants with violating the Fourteenth Amendment by failing to provide timely and sufficient information about the nature and severity of a defendant's alleged conduct while in custody. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar against each defendant."
