  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on September 24, 2019 entered a final judgment against the defendant in a civil action brought by the corporation against him.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the trial court improperly awarded attorney's fees and expert witness fees to the defendant based on its finding that he had engaged in oppressive conduct at the hands of the majority shareholders of the corporation.  According to the complaint, the court found that the defendant was entitled to a fair value of the defendant's shares when, in fact, he did not have a reasonable expectation of paying fair value for those shares because he had resigned as an officer and director and was not required to pay income tax as a shareholder.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as a result of his departure from the corporation, the defendant received more than $261,000 in attorney's and witness fees and expenses.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the jury found the defendant liable for the corporation's misstatements in its determination of fair value, without discounting for lack of marketability or minority status, and without requiring the defendant to pay fair value.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $87,635. The court also ordered the defendants to pay $8339.29 per month in attorney fees and expense, on the basis of which the defendant had not been a shareholder in the corporation for the years in question.  On the same day that the judgment was entered, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court against the defendants, charging them with violations of Section 33-900 of the federal securities laws, and ordering them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest and pay civil penalties of $150,000 each.   The complaint also charges the defendants with violating Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and seeks permanent injunctions against future violations of Sections 33-9, 33-10, and 33-11 of the Exchange Act, and a civil penalty against each of the defendants for the purposes of recovering investor funds from the defendants.  Finally, the case is being handled by Brian McAnneny, Michael McDonald, and Thomas Generis, and the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Office of Investor Education and Advocacy."
