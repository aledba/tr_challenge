  "summary": "On December 3, 2018, the Connecticut Department of Health and Human Services filed an emergency action in federal court in Hartford, Connecticut, charging a former Connecticut police officer with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 7-433c of the federal workers' compensation law.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Connecticut, alleges that the Connecticut State Board of Health, which is responsible for the state's compensation laws, improperly issued a finding and award in favor of Antonio Vitti, the former chief of cardiology at Connecticut's Connecticut Police Department.  According to the complaint, the Commission's finding was inconsistent with the facts of the case, and the Commission was unable to determine whether or not it was reasonable to grant the Commission a final judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from violating the federal securities laws, orders him to pay all benefits due to the plaintiff, and orders the payment of a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Connecticut today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On January 24, 2019, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Connecticut Court of Appeals issued an order enjoining the Commission from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions, ordering the Commission to conduct an independent investigation, and ordering the investigation to be conducted by the Office of Inspector General's Analysis and Detection Center, which uses data analysis tools to detect suspicious patterns of suspicious activity. The Commission's investigation was conducted by John A. Kissel and was supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Connecticut Secretary of State's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 568 (January 24, 2006).  The Commission appreciates assistance from the Connecticut Office of Insurance Regulation, the Department of Justice's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, the Division of Enforcement's Retail Strategy Task Force, the Federal Office of Regulatory Affairs, the State Department of Insurance, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the Massachusetts Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Insurance Regulatory Surveillance Authority. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Thompson, Ms. Barry, and Mr. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages the public to check the background of anyone offering or offering them a job by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and\u00c2\u00a0check the background\u00c2\u00a0of anyone selling or offering\u00c2\u00a0a job."
