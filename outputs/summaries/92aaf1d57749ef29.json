  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama today entered a final judgment ordering the appointment of a successor trustee for the estate of Brian Lee Skelton, Jr., who died on June 7, 1979.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Ala. on July 26, 2016, Brian Lee's will, filed on behalf of his family, included provisions for a testamentary trust that would govern the administration of the estate. The trust, by its terms, was to be terminated upon the death of his wife, Rheta S. Lee, and that the trustee would hold or dispose of the trust principal and any undistributed income by dividing that property into various shares and administering or distributing those shares as otherwise required by the trust.  The complaint further alleged that the trustees were not entitled to the same duties as the trustee in the final settlement as to the estate, that the trust property required division and distribution, that a final income tax return had not been filed for the trust, that outstanding trust expenses had not yet been paid, that Brian Lee \"refused to terminate or distribute the trust to the Beneficiaries, including the South Haven Corp. shares\" and that he \"used his position as Trustee to plunder and misappropriate the assets of the Trust.\"  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the trustee has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The court also granted the trustee's request for a temporary restraining order against future violations of Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the Alabama Secretary of State's Office today announced criminal charges against Brian Lee. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Mary F. Radford, George Gleason Bogert, and George Taylor of the SEC Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Joseph G. Sansone. The case is being supervised by Ansu Banerjee.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Alabama Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Alabama Office of Financial Regulation."
