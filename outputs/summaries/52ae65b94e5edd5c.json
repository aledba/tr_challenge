  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment in favor of a school district that failed to implement an IEP for disabled children.  The court found that the school district failed to meet its obligations under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) by failing to implement the IEP.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Miami, Florida, L.J. was a student in the Broward County public school system during his kindergarten, elementary school, and middle school years. As alleged in the court order, the school failed to comply with the requirements of the IDEA and failed to provide the services required to provide a free appropriate public education for children with disabilities. The court also found that, contrary to what the school claimed, the district did not have sufficient IEP-compliant technology to implement it.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against the school. The SEC's complaint, filed on September 5, 2017, charges the school with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the court also ordered the district court to determine whether to issue an order imposing a permanent injunction, imposing a conduct-based injunction, and ordering a hearing on September 13, 2017. The district court also issued a temporary restraining order and ordered an accounting of the school\u2019s violations of the federal securities laws.  On September 21, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the U.N. Office of Education and the Secretary of State's Office issued an order suspending the suspension of five school district employees. The order also ordered a hearing in which the court will consider the merits of the case and determine whether it is appropriate to order an injunction.  Separately, on September 28, 2017 the Honoree Court of Florida entered a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) and Rule 13b2-3 thereunder. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Department of Education's Division of Education, with the assistance of Assistant Secretary of Education Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Werner, and the case will be supervised by Mr. Gibson. The Court will determine the amount of monetary penalties to be imposed by the court."
