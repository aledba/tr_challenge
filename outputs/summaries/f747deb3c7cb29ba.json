  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Jennifer Hernandez and Alfredo Hernandez, who were charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas, alleges that, from at least December 2009 through December 2016, Jennifer and her older son, Alfredo, were placed in the care of Jennifer's mother, Alfreda, who was incarcerated for drug-and-alcohol charges. According to the complaint, Jennifer had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, anxiety and depression, and was unable to work the case. Alfredo and Jennifer also were ordered to comply with standard welfare orders, including that they cooperate with DHS, comply with court orders, and obey all court orders. The complaint also alleges that Jennifer failed to provide proof of her drug use and that Alfredo had tested positive for methamphetamine, amphetamines, benzodiazepines, and THC. The court found probable cause that Jennifer had not remedied her drug abuse despite her repeated efforts to do so, and that she had failed to disclose to the court that she was using marijuana at a critical time when the trial court would soon reach a decision whether to terminate her parental rights.  In addition, the court found that Jennifer violated Section 9-9-206(a)(5) and Rule 9-3-1 thereunder, and ordered Jennifer to submit to a drug screen and a drug treatment evaluation. Jennifer did not comply with the court's order to remove her from the custody of her mother and father, and she did not respond to an attorney's question about whether she was entitled to a hearing and to a copy of the case plan. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Arkansas today announced criminal charges against Alfredo. The SEC is continuing its investigation into Jennifer's drug use, and the SEC's litigation is being led by Jennifer's father, Ronald Brewer. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Criminal Division. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Hayes. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney's Department for the Central District of Florida, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Arkansas Department of Education, the Internal Revenue Service, the FBI, the Missouri Department of Banking and Securities, the Alabama Department of Insurance, the Mississippi Department of Human Services Criminal Investigations, the Georgia Department of State Attorney General's Office and the FBI's Homicide Task Force."
