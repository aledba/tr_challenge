  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in favor of the pharmaceutical industry.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, alleges that, in 2013 and 2014, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (FDA) issued an order requiring pharmaceutical companies to produce and market a bulk drug product. The order required that manufacturers and suppliers of bulk drug substances be required to produce a \"clinical need\" for the bulk drug substance, which is a product that is not FDA-approved. In addition, the order requires that any manufacturer or supplier of bulk drugs produce a ready-to-use drug product, and requires that the drug be compounded in an outsourcing facility that is subject to FDA's premarket efficacy and safety review. The court's order also requires that manufacturers or suppliers provide a clinical need for their bulk drug products to be included on the FDA's drug shortage list. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the FDA has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 503B of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The final judgment also orders the companies and their affiliated entities to pay a civil penalty of $10,000 each.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Health Education and Advocacy today announced that it has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General also issued an Investor Alert about a potential drug shortage.  Investors can quickly and easily check whether a drug is safe and effective by using this tool.  According to the SEC's Complaint, the agency's methodology for determining whether a specific drug is medically unsuitable for use in a clinical setting is not consistent with the federal agency's approach to evaluating drug safety and efficacy. For example, the SEC alleges that in 2014, when the agency issued an FDA order requiring manufacturers to produce bulk drugs, it failed to consider whether a particular drug substance was necessary for the clinical need. The SEC also alleges that the FDA order required manufacturers to submit to FDA a clinical-need determination before compounding with a drug substance. In contrast, the complaint alleges that FDA's method of determining clinical need does not require manufacturers to make a clinical difference in a drug product when the drug is not approved for use. The complaint further alleges that neither the FDA nor the SEC have agreed to the imposition of a penalty"
