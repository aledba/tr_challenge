  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Lamar Central Outdoor, LLC, a California-based outdoor advertising company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Bakersfield, California, alleges that, in 1995, Lamar built a wooden, double-sided, \"static\" billboard next to a public highway in Kern County pursuant to an outdoor advertising permit issued by the California Department of Transportation.  According to the complaint, Lamar's message center display was located within 1,000 feet of two already-existing message center displays on the same side of the highway.  As alleged, however, this spacing requirement did not apply to any of the messages.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Lamar failed to meet its burden to show that the spacing requirement was unreasonable or legally incorrect.  Lamar's complaint charges that, at the time of the amendment, Lamar submitted another permit application on the ground that it did not comply with the spacing requirements.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Lamar has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $10,000.  On August 24, 2018, the court granted Lamar's request for a temporary restraining order, entered a preliminary injunction, and ordered Lamar to return to his original position as a defendant in the case.  After a hearing on August 26, 2019, Lamar agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the company's name.  To settle the case, Lamar will also be required to provide a copy of the final judgment, which is subject to court approval.
