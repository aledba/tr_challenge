  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Texas resident Ruben Lee Allen, finding that he violated the separation-of-powers provision of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, alleges that Allen violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Allen, who was previously convicted of aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon, agreed to settle the SEC's charges by agreeing to pay a $200 \"summoning witness/mileage\" fee that was not related to the actual trial of a criminal defendant.  Allen also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years.  In addition, Allen agreed to pay $200 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his criminal conviction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, Allen consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the securities laws, and orders him to pay civil penalties of $200 and $200, respectively.   The final judgment also prohibits Allen from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of a civil injunctive action, and bars him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney or a judge in a criminal case.  On October 5, 2017, the court granted Allen's motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to surrender his passport, which he has not yet done.  As part of the settlement, Allen has agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar, to be permanently enjoined from associating with any law enforcement organization, and to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  To settle the case, Allen will be required to show cause and consent to entry of a judgment that imposes a permanent injunction against future violations of the anti-fraud provisions, and will be subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 523 S.W.3d (Houston, Texas, July 18, 2017).  The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa, Chief of the Criminal Division of the Texas Department of Public Safety. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov."
