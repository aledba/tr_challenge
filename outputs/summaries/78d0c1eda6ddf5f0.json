  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire today entered a final judgment against Kia Motors America, Inc. (\"Kia\"), a New Hampshire-based automobile manufacturer, for failing to adequately staff and train its dealers.  According to the court's order, Kia violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that Kia failed to adequately adequately staff its parts and service department and to adequately train its parts-counter person.  In addition, the court found that, prior to Kia's November 2014 cure letter, Somersworth was without a service manager, a service advisor/service consultant, and a parts counter person, all of whom were required by the dealership's franchise agreement.  As alleged in the complaint, the dealers were in a revolving-door workplace with unprecedented turnover rates.  Kia management worked with Somersworth to remedy its staffing and training deficiencies, met with Kia to discuss its concerns, and gave Somersworth the \"benefit of the doubt\" when the dealer promised to hire the appropriate number of staff members.  On November 6, 2014, the Board of Directors issued an order suspending Kia from violating the franchise provisions of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the Board's findings, the company consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins it from violating these provisions, and from future violations of the securities laws, from participating in any dealer-registration program, from engaging in any type of conduct that constitutes a violation of the dealers' franchise agreement, from acquiring or selling a car, to participating in an offering of a vehicle, to providing a dealer with the opportunity to remediate a breach that occurred during a look-back period.  Additionally, the order imposes a $25,000 civil penalty.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner and Glenn S. Gordon of the SEC's Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Connecticut, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the New Hampshire Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
