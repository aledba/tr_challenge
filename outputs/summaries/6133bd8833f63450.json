  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant in her divorce from a second defendant.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, in 2016, the trial court granted the parties a divorce based upon irreconcilable differences in the amount of child support they received.  According to the complaint, the court found that, during the pendency of the divorce, the respondent mischaracterized the parents' financial contributions as giving rise to only a moral obligation for repayment, and did not consider the fact that the respondent had removed one half of the funds from the 529 account during his parenting time.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the court improperly apportioned the respondent's real estate, where the parties had resided and operated a bed and breakfast, to the respondent.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay full child support to the defendant. The final judgment also orders the defendant to pay $2,872 in interest and a $6,913 civil penalty.   The court's order also prohibits the defendant from imposing any monetary penalty or imposing a civil penalty on the defendant, unless the court finds that the defendant has demonstrated reasonable cause to do so. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Welshhans and Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New York State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
