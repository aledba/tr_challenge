  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against a Utah-based escort service agency and its owner for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that, while employed as an escort, Karlie Kidd met an undercover Salt Lake city police officer at the Grand America Hotel and asked him for a \u201cshow-up\u201d fee before she can obtain relief. According to the complaint, Kidd was not licensed to provide sexually oriented business services in that municipality, and she did not have an escort services license from that municipality. The complaint alleges that Kidd violated Section 10-8-41.5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that she violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act by failing to adequately preserve her First Amendment and Equal Protection of the Law. The SEC alleges that the SEC's judgment against Kidd violated the First Amendment, which requires a court to determine whether a defendant has a right to a fair and just hearing before making a First Amendment claim.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Kidd.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Defendants agreed to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions. Defendants also agreed to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica entered a temporary restraining order against Kidd and ordered her to return to the district court for a hearing scheduled for May 26, 2018. The court also ordered Kidd to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Kidd, charging her with violations of Section 5. The same day, the Utah Attorney General's Office issued an order appointing an independent receiver to oversee the investigation of Kidd's alleged violations.  A parallel administrative proceeding was instituted against Kidd by the Utah Secretary of State's Office and the Utah Division of Criminal Justice. The investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Ms. C. Dumornay. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Utah Department of Public Health and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
