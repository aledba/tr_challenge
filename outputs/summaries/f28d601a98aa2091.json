  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two Ohio men for their roles in a fraudulent mortgage remodification scheme.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Jason J. Howder and Christopher J. Keating violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, in 2011, the federal government launched the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) to encourage distressed homeowners to submit mortgage payments to Keating, instead of to their mortgagees, in order to reduce their monthly mortgage obligations.  As alleged, Keating and Howder engaged in a scheme that resulted in at least twenty-five victims losing their homes.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Keating was the \"defacto leader\" of the HAMP scheme, and Keating aided and abetted his role in HAMP.  Keating agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Section 3553 of the Exchange Act and to pay $1,183,025.88 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his sentence.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief, and imposing a $250,000 civil penalty.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 3554, and ordered Keating to pay a $1 million civil penalty and a $500,000 bar.  On May 5, 2015, a federal district court in Miami, Florida issued a temporary restraining order against Howder from violating these provisions, ordering him to comply with the court's order, and appointing a receiver for each of his victims.   The court also issued a final order imposing a penalty of $561,862.80, for a total of $1.8 million, for causing substantial financial harm to only five or more victims of HAMP, for further determination by the court upon motion of the SEC. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Florida, and the Federal Office of Inspector General."
