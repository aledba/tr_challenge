  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment against Nathaniel Walden, a Holmes County, Mississippi man who was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on April 28, 2005, Walden shot and killed his sister-in-law, Mary Walden. The complaint alleges that Walden confronted his brother, James, about a missing saw and told him that he would not leave his property until he was certain that the evidence at trial supported his conviction for murder. Walden allegedly told his brother that he was going to kill James and that the state would recommend him to take a manslaughter plea deal.  Walden also allegedly claimed that his trial counsel, Jimmy Hull, was ineffective for presenting an accident defense when there was no evidence to support his murder conviction.  The complaint further alleges that the court improperly denied Walden's request for a temporary restraining order, which would have prevented him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also found that the defendant had failed to adequately review the evidence presented in his defense, and that he had not been fully advised by his counsel that there was a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceeding would have been different without an accident or self-defense.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Walden arising from the same conduct alleged in his previous PCR motion. The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General in this matter."
