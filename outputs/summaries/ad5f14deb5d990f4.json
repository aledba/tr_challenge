  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against the Seminole Tribe of Florida, which filed a civil injunctive action on September 30, 2016, seeking to bar the imposition of a Florida state tax on utility services, which the Tribe uses to conduct on-reservation activities that are regulated by federal law.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, the Tribe alleged that Florida's Utility Tax was preempted by a prior court order imposing the tax on utilities services provided to the Tribe on tribal land.  The complaint further alleged that the Tribe had failed to show that the federal and tribal interests at stake were sufficient to justify the imposition or collection of the tax.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the court had not determined whether the Tribe was entitled to the same preclusion as it claimed in its prior action.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the Tribe to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Additionally, the court granted the Tribe's request for a temporary restraining order against further violations of the federal securities laws.  On September 29, 2017, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court against the Tribe, alleging that it violated the antitrust provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) and (g) of\u00c2\u00a0the federal securities law, and that the defendants violated Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 thereunder. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the defendants.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Ragsdale and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Department of Revenue."
