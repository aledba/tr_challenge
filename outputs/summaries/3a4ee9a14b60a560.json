  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Ohio today announced criminal charges against a Cuyahoga County woman who pleaded guilty to improperly handling a firearm in a motor vehicle, a first-degree felony, and carrying concealed weapons, a second-degree misdemeanor, in violation of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint alleges that S.J. Gibson, who was previously barred by the trial court from serving as an officer or director of a home health care business, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Gibson consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the federal laws, and orders her to pay $850 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced that it has filed an emergency action against Gibson, charging him with violating Section 15(b)(5) and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorging interest of $850, and to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar. Gibson agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
