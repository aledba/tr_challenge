  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Ohio today announced criminal charges against a Cleveland man accused of shooting and killing his brother in a bar.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Cleveland, alleges that Ravonte Carter, a resident of the same neighborhood as Donovan Alexander, shot and killed his brother on December 22, 2016, at Jolly's Place, a bar located on the corner of Hulda Avenue and East 110th Street in Cleveland.  According to the complaint, Carter told the bar owner that he and Donovan had been arguing in the bar that night and that he was going to get his gun and \"light this whole house up.\"  The complaint further alleges that Carter's statements to Hobbs, who also lives across the street from the bar, were inconsistent with the evidence presented to the jury.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, after Carter confronted Hobbs about the shooting, he pulled out a gun and fired four or five shots at Hobbs.  After Hobbs confronted him about the firing, the jury deliberated for a short period of time before finding Carter guilty on all counts and ordering him to be sentenced to 18 years to life in prison.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Carter consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest.  Carter also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay disgorgement of $1,078.71, prejudgment interests of $2,038.81, and a civil penalty of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 598 (Feb. 24, 2019).  The case is being supervised by C.J.
