  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Utah today announced criminal charges against Reyfus Mellow Graves, a resident of Emery County, Utah, who was charged with attempted murder in connection with the April 14, 2016 shooting.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Graves, who had moved to Ferron just three months prior, made the following exclamation as he fired his weapon: \u201cThis is how we do it in Puerto Rico!\u201d  According to the complaint, Graves then allegedly told one of the men that he was going to show him how to do it and that he would show them how.  As alleged, however, as the complaint alleges, Graves continued to point the gun at the men even after he felt Graves go limp, and continued to hit him with his fists, continuing to punch him even after the men left the apartment.  In a parallel criminal action, Graves was found guilty on all four counts of attempted murder and sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Paul J. McCleskey of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Graves that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a $25,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Graves has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge $1,000 in prejudgment interests, and ordering a conduct-based injunction against Graves.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
