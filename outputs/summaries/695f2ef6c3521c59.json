  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of California announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for denying a visa application to a Pakistani doctor for graduate medical education.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that the HHS violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Visas\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, HHS and DHS violated Section 1182(a)(15)(J) and Rule 12(b)(5) thereunder, and that HHS failed to consider the relevant facts in the case.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  HHS has also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order suspending the issuance of a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of HHS, and ordering HHS to comply with the court's order suspending HHS from issuing any security-related emergency relief.  On August 29, 2016, the D.C. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final consent judgment against HHS against Raoof, finding that he had violated the relevant provisions of the Exchange Visas Act of 1940. The court granted HHS's request for an emergency relief, including an asset freeze, and ordered HSH to return to its original location. HHS agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction. The Court granted the request for a preliminary injunction, and HSH agreed to a conduct-based injunction, which prohibits it from issuing or denying an order to HHS or any other entity related to the subject matter of the complaint. HSH has agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public health organization. The settlement is subject to court approval. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and U.K. Secret Service (FSA)."
