  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of terminating the parental rights of two Mississippi children.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that J.P., the children's natural father, and N.P. (the mother) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 93-17-7 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 13(a) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the SEC found that, contrary to the SEC's findings, the children were harmed by the drug use of their father and the absence and neglect of their mother.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the children suffered significant physical and mental harm because of their exposure to the drug.  As alleged in the complaint filed in the SEC, from the time they were separated in December 2013 through January 2014, N. P. and her husband began using methamphetamine, which was then used to treat anxiety and to support their lifestyle.  During this time, J. P.'s drug use increased significantly, and the children began to show signs of withdrawal from the drug, which led them to seek permanent injunctions against the use of the drug and to seek the return of the children to their natural parents.  On October 21, 2014, the court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered the children placed in the custody of a family member, who was later convicted of drug-related criminal charges and sentenced to prison for five years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against each of them. The court also granted the family member's request for an officer-and-director bar and a penny stock bar, and issued an order requiring the family to pay a $1,000 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000. The order also prohibits the family from associating with anyone with a history of drug or alcohol-related conduct, and from participating in any offering of any kind of investment in a business or investment in an organization.  Additionally, the order prohibits the placement of children under the age of 12 without reasonable explanation, and orders the family members to provide for the children at a reasonable time.
