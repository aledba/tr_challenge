  "summary": "On April 12, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a final judgment against defendant Kareem T. Jackson, Jr., who was convicted of disrupting public services in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Ohio, Jackson was arrested on September 27, 2017 after he allegedly broke into the home of Renae Fearing, Fearing's neighbor, and attempted to steal her cell phone.  The complaint alleges that Fearing confronted Jackson after she confronted him about the alleged theft and that Jackson immediately confronted her and threw the phone at the wall, causing the phone to ring and causing it to fall to the ground.  As alleged in the complaint, Jackson's actions caused Fearing to be unable to access her phone and caused her to lose her hearing.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Jackson.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Jackson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $150,000.  Jackson also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay a $75,000 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  On May 24, 2019, the court entered a temporary restraining order against Jackson, ordering him to return to his home, and imposing a $50,000 penalty against him.  At a hearing on May 26, 2019 in the United Kingdom, the SEC charged Jackson with violating the antiphasing provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(5) of The Securities Act.  It also charged Fearing with aiding and abetting Jackson's violations of Section 13(a)(1) and 13(b).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Kelly L. Gibson, John R. Rymas, and Glenn S. Gordon of the Chicago Regional Office, with the assistance of the Office of Professional and Risk Analysis, and the case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Division of Criminal Justice and Public Finance.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-13, 2018"
