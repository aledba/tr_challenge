  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Kansas City man who was convicted of making a false threat to a public figure.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, alleges that Timothy C. Boettger violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he violated the pre-clearance provisions of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  In its judgment, the court found that, in a reasonable and reasonable state of mind, a person can make a threat with the intent of causing a threat.  According to the court's order, however, the First Amendment does not permit a person to make a \"false threat\" and does not require a reasonable person to believe that the speaker intends to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals.  Boettner also agreed with the majority's finding that a \"true threat\" does not qualify as a \"threat\" when, in fact, a true threat is a statement of intent to cause harm or a threat to another person.  For example, the Court previously ruled that a person who makes a threat in reckless disregard of the risk of causing harm could be liable for a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's case, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the charged provisions, ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.   The court also granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") as well as an officer-and-director bar, and ordered the defendants to pay a $75,000 civil penalty. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Birkenheier and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kansas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
