  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against a Kansas-based medical practice licensing company and its former owner for violating the corporate practice of medicine doctrine.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, alleges that the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) and Kansas City-based Central Kansas Medical Center (CKMC) violated the corporate practices of medicine by failing to enforce certain provisions of the state's medical licensing laws.  For example, the complaint alleges that in 2011, the KDHE granted a temporary restraining order against Central Kansas medical practice license holder Dr. Stanley Hatesohl from practicing family medicine in Kansas.  According to the complaint, the court found that the KCDHE's pre-employment covenants did not apply to a specific medical practice, and that the contract did not cover family medicine services.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their ill-gotten gains.  In a parallel action, the Kansas Attorney General's Office today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action against the defendants, seeking summary judgment against each of them, as well as a permanent injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws, and a civil penalty for each of the defendants. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kansas Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kansas Office of Inspector General in this matter."
