  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against defendant Kayvon Patton on consent for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 19, 2018 in federal court in San Diego, Patton pleaded guilty to grand theft of personal property and was sentenced to three years of formal probation under various conditions with a stay of 240 days in local custody pending successful completion of probation. The SEC alleges that Patton was with friends from school and \"the streets\" when two men entered the store and stole cell phones and other electronic devices from the front counter. The complaint alleges that, in exchange for his probation, Patton agreed to a five-year, $4,600 civil penalty and to pay a $1,500 civil penalty. Patton also agreed to be barred from purchasing or selling any type of electronic device other than a smartphone. The court's order also prohibits Patton from raising a constitutional challenge to the imposition of a penalty that is unrelated to the actual nature of the alleged crime.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Patton.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Sheena K. and Melvin L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General of the San Diego Division of Criminal Justice."
