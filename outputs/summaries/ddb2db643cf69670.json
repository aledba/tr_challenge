  "summary": "On June 5, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a temporary restraining order against John Doe, an Ohio State University student accused of sexual assault on campus.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Cincinnati, John Doe was falsely told that he had a right to a live hearing and an opportunity to share his version of the events at a college or university hearing.  The complaint alleges that, in reality, the university's policy and procedures on student sexual assault violated due process.  As alleged in the complaint, Doe had access to a confidential, non-judgmental hearing that was conducted by an external investigator, and the hearing was conducted in the presence of an attorney or other support person.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Doe has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan today announced criminal charges against Doe arising from the same conduct.  On June 6, the court granted a preliminary injunction against the University of Michigan and ordered the university to provide Doe with a copy of its Final Report, which was prepared by the college's Office of Institutional Equity (OIE).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott A. Mascianica of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Attorney General's Office and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (Aug. 25, 2017).  In related matters, the SEC is seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions, conduct-based injunctions against future violations, and an officer-and-director bar against the university from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply as a college student.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation of the alleged misconduct by the Ohio Department of Education, which conducted the investigation, concluded that the university violated the antifascibility provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0The\u00c2\u00a0Securities Act of 1940, and Rule\u00c2\u00a05(a) thereunder.\u00c2\u00a0In addition, the Commission has issued an order requiring the University to conduct a \"live hearing\" in accordance with the policies"
