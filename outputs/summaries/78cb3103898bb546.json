  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the County of Yolo in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.  The SEC's complaint alleges that on March 21, 2009, Dwight Meddock was injured when a tree fell on him while he was in the parking lot of Elkhorn Regional Park in Sacramento, California.  According to the complaint, as alleged, the tree was diseased and partly rotted and was in constant danger of falling, and the County was liable for failing to maintain the park in a safe condition.  In a parallel action, the California Secretary of State's Office today announced that it had obtained a court order requiring the County to apply for a temporary restraining order against the tree.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed in federal district court in Yolo, California, the Court granted the County's motion for summary judgment on the basis of the court's order, and granted the Commission's request for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the Court's findings, the County consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Paul G. Sansone of the Court of Appeals for the District of San Francisco entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the County from violating Section 831.2 of the federal securities laws, and orders the Commission to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  Separately, the Commission has agreed to a settlement where it will determine whether to impose a $50,000 penalty. The Commission has also agreed to an order appointing a receiver to determine the amount of civil money that will be distributed to the receiver, and to pay an officer and director bar in the event of an emergency. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the California Office of Inspector General in this matter."
