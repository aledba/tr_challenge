  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Federal Election Commission (FEC) in a related administrative proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the Commission violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  The complaint also alleges that, contrary to the Commission's findings, the Commission improperly relied on sworn declarations from CPD officers and directors, which were not supported by the Commission.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants failed to adequately consider the evidence presented in the complaint, and the Commission failed to properly consider the facts presented in its response to the complaint.  For example, as set forth in the Complaint, the Court found that the CPD violated the federal securities laws when it failed to consider the relevant facts of the complaint and failed to provide sufficient evidence to determine whether the Commission had violated the charged provisions of the SEC's Rules of Practice.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission&rsquo;s complaint, Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the Commission from violating these provisions, and orders the Commission to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Defendants also agreed to be barred from serving as officers or directors of any political party or political organization for five years, and to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  On August 11, 2017, the SEC filed a complaint against the Commission alleging that it violated the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to properly review and consider material evidence presented to it in its investigation of the matter.  Specifically, it alleged that, among other things, that defendants misrepresented that CPD staff members engaged in prohibited conduct in the course of their work.  According to the SEC, this misrepresentation was consistent with the complaint's finding that the agency had improperly relied upon material evidence that it had not reviewed, and that the complaint did not support or support any of the recommendations in its opinion.  As a result, the court found that defendants violated the Commission and Rule 10b2-1 thereunder, and ordered the Commission &rsqua;s investigation to be conducted in a \"strong and careful manner.\"  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against defendants.  To settle the charges, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) today announced parallel criminal prosecutions against defendants"
