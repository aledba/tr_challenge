  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment in favor of the City of Asheville against PHG Asheville, LLC, a company seeking a conditional use permit.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Asheville, North Carolina, alleges that on 27 July 2016, the Asheville City Council issued an order denying PHG\u2019s application for a conditional-use permit based on its finding that the hotel would not substantially injure the value of adjoining and adjacent properties.  According to the complaint, however, the City Council had failed to consider whether PHG had presented competent, material, and substantial evidence to support its decision to deny the application.  In its order, the court found that the city had improperly relied upon the testimony of two appraisers, Tommy Crozier and Charles Rawls, to determine whether the hotel met its burden of production and, if appropriate, whether it would be entitled to the issuance of the permit. The court also found that, based upon this finding, the city lacked the authority to deny PHG the permit because it did not consider the evidence presented by the appraiser.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's order, PHG consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the city from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the city to conduct a whole record review of the proposed hotel.  To learn more about conditional use permits, see http://www.sec.gov/conditional-use-permit-requirements.html.  For further information, see Press Release No. 17-20/2019.  This press release also alleges that, in a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the company for its role in a multi-level administrative proceeding that resulted in a temporary restraining order and an order requiring the company to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $1.5 million.   The complaint also charges the company with violating the anti-dumping provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (d) and 10(e) the federal securities laws and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Finally, the complaint seeks a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 15(a)(1) and Rule 15a-3 thereunder and a permanent injunction from future violations"
