  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against a Nevada man accused of carjacking.  The SEC's complaint alleges that LeCharles Baldon, a resident of Reno, Nevada, accessed a storage unit before his first meeting with an FBI agent. According to the complaint, Baldon entered the storage unit, stored his drugs in the unit, and paid cash in person to extend the lease. The complaint further alleges that Baldon used a drug dog to alert the agent that he had access to a gun. The SEC alleges that the dog alerted Baldon to the gun and alerted the agent, who then arrested Baldon and arrested him. Baldon pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to 184 months in prison. The court found that the defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 184 months. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has issued an\u00c2\u00a0order\u00c2\u00a0to determine whether to impose a civil injunctive relief, impose an officer-and-director bar, and impose a $75,000 civil penalty.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.
