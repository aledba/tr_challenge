  "summary": "On February 7, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against Bartlett Care Center, doing business as French Park Care, Inc., that permanently enjoins the facility from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the Facility from future violations of the federal securities laws.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in San Diego, California, Jasmine Lopez signed a two-page arbitration agreement signed by her daughter, Mariana Godinez, on January 15, 2017. The court found that the arbitration agreement was not procedurally unconscionable as to Jasmine and that she had no authority to execute the agreement on her behalf.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Jasmine.  As alleged in the complaint, Godinez signed the agreement in an office where she was not present and at a time later than and separate from the entry of the judgment.  She also allegedly signed an arbitration agreement that required her daughter to arbitrate those claims in her individual capacity.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the Facility and Godinez consented to an order permanently enjoining each of them from violating these provisions. The Court also granted the Facility's request for an asset freeze and other emergency relief, including an officer-and-director bar, and ordered the Facility to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 587-844 (January 2015).  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's Investor.gov website to quickly and easily identify people selling investments in or offering to invest in an investment in a real estate development project. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the California Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
