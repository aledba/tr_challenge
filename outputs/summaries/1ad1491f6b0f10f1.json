  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was convicted of a felony for failing to tender a lesser-included instruction on dealing in methamphetamine as a class B felony.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in Huntington, Indiana, on May 19, 2014, a man called the Huntington County Sheriff's Department on its non-emergency line and reported that he was strung out on methamphetamine and \"was about to commit a felony.\"  The court found that the defendant was liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he had a duty to protect the safety of the community.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Davis.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Davis violated Section 924(c)(3)(B) and Section 16(a) of that federal securities law.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Davis consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Davis also agreed to be enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any civil injunctive relief.  On June 6, 2019, the court granted a temporary restraining order against Davis and ordered him to return to his home state of Indiana, where he was previously incarcerated for a prior felony, to be barred from the office of the attorney general, and to pay an officer-and-director bar in the amount of $1,000. The court also granted a preliminary injunction against Davis, ordering him to surrender his passport, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against him.  A hearing on June 13, 2019 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Indiana Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Indiana Department of Health and Human Services in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 7, 2019)."
