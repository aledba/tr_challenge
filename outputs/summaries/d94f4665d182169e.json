  "summary": "On July 1, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered final judgments against the Illinois Department of Public Health and its director in an administrative proceeding related to involuntary transfers or discharge of nursing home residents.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Will County, Illinois, alleges that, in July 2012, Lakewood Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, LLC (Lakewood) instituted administrative proceedings for the involuntary discharge of a nursing home resident. The complaint alleges that Lakewood violated the antifraud provisions of Section 3-411 of the Nursing Home Care Act of 1940 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the Department did not violate the statutory time requirements of the federal securities laws. Lakewood's complaint also alleges that the District Attorney's Office issued a report and recommendation in which it recommended that the department conduct a hearing on the notice of involuntary transfer or discharge within 10 days of the resident's request. The court's order, which is subject to court approval, prohibits the Department from conducting a hearing beyond 10 days after a resident requests it to do so. The Court's order also prohibits Lakewood from providing for subpoenas of witnesses and documentary evidence, and requires the Department to review the record, findings, and recommendations of the court. In a parallel action, the Illinois Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Lakewood.  In a related administrative proceeding, the Department of Health and Human Services today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action and obtained an emergency court order halting the pending litigation. The SEC also announced that the Division of Enforcement's Office of Inspector General has issued an order suspending the issuance of a subpoena and ordering the department to conduct an independent examination of the matter. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by Richard M. Daley and Timothy S. Jost, and supervised by Amy C. McKinley of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois State Auditor's Office in this matter."
