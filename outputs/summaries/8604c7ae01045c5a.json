  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of class certification against a San Rafael, California-based company accused of defrauding retail investors.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, alleges that, in 2014, James Noel of San Rafael purchased an inflatable outdoor pool marketed as Kids Stuff Ready Set Pool 8FT X 25IN, which purported to be a putative consumer class.  According to the complaint, Noel claimed that he had not demonstrated the existence of an ascertainable class when he set up the pool and discovered that it was much smaller than the picture on the packaging.  In addition, the complaint alleged that Noel had not provided sufficient evidence to prove that he was a member of a class, and that he did not have the means to prove it.  As the complaint further alleges, Noel had failed to provide sufficient evidence for the class to be certified.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Noel consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2,038, and a $100,000 civil penalty for a further five years.  Finally, the court issued an order suspending Noel from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering him to provide evidence in support of his motion for class certification.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17(b)(3) of 2013, Judgment No. 206 of the United States Court of Appeals for the Southern District of New York, Order No. 207 of the Commission on Civil Procedure and Rule 206 of Regulation No. 208 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Separately, the Court of Appeal has issued a temporary restraining order against Noel from further violations of the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws.  On May 24, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Noel, charging him with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(e) of The Securities Act, and Rule 17a-3 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against Noel and a penalty against him, and an order prohibiting him from participating in any class action"
