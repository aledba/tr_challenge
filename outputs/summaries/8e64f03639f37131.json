  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Maryland today entered a final judgment against a Baltimore City Police Department officer charged with unlawfully using video excerpts of trial testimony during closing arguments.  According to the SEC's complaint, on December 28, 2014, officers Dancy Debrosse, Isiah Smith, Kevin Leary, and Russell Cagle responded to a triggered security alarm at a convenience store in Baltimore, Maryland. The complaint alleges that Cagle, who was wearing a mask and later identified as Michael Johansen, opened the convenience store door and advanced towards the officers, who were standing in a line of fire. Cagle allegedly asked the court to allow him to use the video excerpts during closing argument, which he did. The court granted Cagle's request, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to use a slide-in recording of the defendants' testimony and to present a video recording of a pretrial statement made by Johansen that had been introduced into evidence. The SEC alleges that the trial court failed to exercise its discretion in precluding Cagle from using the recorded testimony during the closing arguments, and instead allowed Cagle to present the video recording as always inappropriate.  The SEC's Complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore on September 3, 2015, charges Cagle with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Maryland today announced criminal charges against Cagle arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint.  Cagle has agreed to settle the charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On September 2, 2018, the Court of Special Appeals issued a temporary restraining order, ordering Cagle and Smith to comply with the court's order. The order also ordered Cagle not to use any video or audio recording in closing arguments and to provide the SEC with an accounting of the amount of time and effort spent on the matter. The Court also issued an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver. The receiver will be provided with a copy of the recording that the receiver provided to the receiver, and the physical CD on which the receiver was stored will be used to record the receiver's statement."
