  "summary": "On May 22, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against W.J. Menkins Holdings, LLC, a Pennsylvania-based company that owns and operates a quarry trucking business.  The court's order, which entered on June 28, 2018, permanently enjoins the company from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 27-405 and 27-904 of the Pennsylvania Municipal Code, and orders it to provide a temporary restraining order and other relief.  In its order, the court also granted the company's request for a variance, which is subject to court approval.  According to the order, filed in federal court in Berks County, Pennsylvania, on May 4, 2016, the company entered a study of heavy vehicle noise from the property on October 26, 2016 during which it measured the sound made by two dump trucks idling and then revving louder every thirty seconds to simulate trucks accelerating and leaving the property.  As alleged in the complaint, the study, which was conducted by Robert G. Richardson and Joseph Zadlo, was not supported by the ZHB's finding that the property was substantially rural, consisting mostly of farmland, and that trucks moving on gravel would not be adverse to the public's outdoor environment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's judgment, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The court also ordered the company to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  On June 26, 2018 the court granted the request for the variance, without taking additional evidence, for the purpose of granting the company a temporary injunction, ordering it to return to the district court for a hearing on June 27, 2018.
