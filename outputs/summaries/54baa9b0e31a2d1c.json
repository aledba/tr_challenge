  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against four former employees of Elite Imports, a car dealership, for their roles in a scheme to defraud lenders and insurance companies.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, alleges that Elite's former employees were engaged in a variety of illegal schemes, including a multi-layered scheme that defrauded multiple car dealership customers.  According to the complaint, from 2012 to 2015, Elite's employees engaged in an extensive scheme to fraudulently obtain financing from floor-plan lenders.  As alleged, the defendants used the dealership's resources to acquire and sell cars in bulk.  For example, one employee allegedly opened an insurance policy on a red Ducati motorcycle in August 2013, and a few months later, he reported the motorcycle stolen and collected $1,600.90 in insurance proceeds.  In a parallel criminal action, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana last month sentenced Hamza Dridi to 72 months in prison and ordered him to pay $1.811,679.25 in restitution.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Dridi consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Dridi also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his disgorgement plus prejudgment interest thereon.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.   \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related case, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Mahdi Khelefi and Issa Kayyali, alleging that they aided and abetted Elite's violations of the anti-fraud provisions and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 16(a)(1) and 17(b)(2) of\u00c2\u00a0Securities Act of 1940 and Rule 16a-3 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of these provisions. \u00c2"
