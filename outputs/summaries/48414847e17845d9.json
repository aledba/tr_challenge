  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a company that filed an application for a permit to operate an asphalt plant in Ashe County, North Carolina.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in June 2015, Appalachian Materials, LLC submitted an application to the County for an application under the \"Permit Choice\" program. The application was initially denied, in part, because the application did not meet the requirements of the state-issued permit. The complaint further alleges that the Planning Director denied the application based on his June 2015 letter to Appalachian Materials stating that the application was sufficiently completed when submitted, prior to the October 2015 Moratorium, to warrant a permit. According to the complaint, however, the application had not yet been processed when the Moratorium was lifted and replaced with a new ordinance, which created additional barriers for the permit application to be issued.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina today announced criminal charges against the company.  On June 24, 2017, the U. S. District Judge William J. Bentsen of the Western District of South Carolina granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against the alleged violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an order requiring the company to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the company consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing on June 26, 2017 will be held on the matter of a related administrative proceeding.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (2014).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the SEC Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Office of Inspector General in this matter."
