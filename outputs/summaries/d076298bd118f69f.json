  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against the District of Columbia in favor of B.G.'s request for a Due Process Hearing to determine whether the district violated the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago on September 19, 2014, B. G. and his mother, Nicole Cintron, were evaluated by the district's Individualized Education Program (IEP) team. The hearing officer found that the IEP team failed to consider the pros and cons of the IEE team's findings. The complaint alleges that the hearing officer was wrong to conclude that B. g. had a specific learning disability and that he should not have been classified as learning disabled.  The complaint further alleges that C.G.'s mother, Mari Lane, and her husband, Yazmin Coehlo, failed to adequately assess whether B.g. had an intellectual disability.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against B. Ghazali. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by the Chicago Regional Office and the Office of Education Education and Advocacy. The litigation will be led by John Rymas. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Education's Office of Advocacy and Education Risk Analysis.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Department of Education, and the Illinois State Board of Education in this matter.
