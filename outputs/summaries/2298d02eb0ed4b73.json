  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas today entered a final judgment against a Texas-based mother and her husband in a child custody case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that Crystal Melody Meekins, a Texas resident, filed a motion to transfer her daughter, C.G.M.-N., to Illinois in 2013 in violation of the federal child custody laws.  Meekin also alleges that the trial court improperly transferred the child support proceeding to Illinois.  According to the complaint, the court improperly held the child custody proceeding in Texas until it determined that the child had a significant connection to Texas and that it had jurisdiction to make an initial child custody determination.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Florida today announced that it would not impose a permanent injunction on Nahorski's motion for enforcement, instead requiring him to show cause and effect, including a copy of the court's order, that he had consented to the entry of the final judgment, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  On August 7, 2017, the U. S. District Judge in Houston granted the motion for a temporary restraining order and issued an order freezing the assets of the defendants, including the assets and other assets, of the relief defendants.  As set forth in the court order, the defendants agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a final judgement that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws, imposes a civil penalty of $100,000, and requires Meekint to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $10,000.  Additionally, the judge granted the defendants' request for a hearing on their motion for an injunction, which is subject to court approval, and granted the parties the right to apply for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the right of a court to determine the amount of money owed to the relief defendant in a civil action.
