  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon today entered a final judgment against a former truck driver who was denied the right to participate in a workers\u2019 compensation scheme.  The court found that, in enacting the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, the employer-employee relationship was defined and used as a rule of law to determine whether a person was entitled to receive the minimum wage for a job performed by an employer.  According to the court\u2019s order, on June 4, 2014, a commercial truck driver was sent on a supervised delivery by and for an employer as a result of a pre-employment drive test.  As alleged in the order, however, that the employer had not agreed to provide services for a remuneration and that the claimant had not engaged in the preparation of the delivery.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Van Hyning consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  In a parallel action, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) today announced that it has obtained a court order halting an ongoing investigation into the alleged violations of the federal anti-fraud provisions, including Section 17(a)(1) of Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  It also issued an order suspending the issuance of an officer-and-director bar and ordering the investigation to be conducted by the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, with assistance from the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis.   The litigation will be led by Matthew Bender and supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the Boston Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The case is being supervised by Jan Folena, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit, and Ms. Folena is supervising the case."
