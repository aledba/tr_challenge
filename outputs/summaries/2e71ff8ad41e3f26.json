  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana yesterday entered a final judgment against Jeffrey Fairbanks, Jr., a convicted felon, for felony neglect of a dependent resulting in death.  The court found that Fairbanks violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also found that, in admitting the SEC's findings, Fairbanks consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 404 of the Exchange Act, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. Fairbanks also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of Rule 404(b).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Indianapolis, charges Fairbanks with violating Rule 404, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgment of illusory gains plus interest, and a penalty equal to the amount of his civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Indiana today announced criminal charges against Fairbanks arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On May 28, 2015, Janna's mother and half-sisters were home, and Fairbanks left the house with his daughter wrapped in a blanket. He returned, alone, late that night. The next morning, police questioned Fairbanks and he told them that he had buried the baby in a cornfield and that he never told them how Janna died. The complaint also alleges that, during an early morning diaper change, he placed a pillow over the baby to \"muffle her\" and that, later, he took the pillow off \"right away.\" The complaint further alleges that he later woke up, realized Janna was \u201calready gone,\u201d and panicked. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Fairbanks's guilty plea. The case was handled by Gregory P. Joseph and Stephen A. Saltzburg of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Indiana State Attorney General's Office, and the Indiana Bureau of Criminal Investigation."
