  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the SEC's motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against the defendants.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Memphis, Tennessee, alleges that defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by printing more than the last five digits of a consumer's credit card number on receipts given to him and purported class members.  According to the complaint, the SEC found that defendants had the capability to circumvent the federal securities laws by printing the card numbers in full on receipts.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the SEC obtained a court order requiring merchants to provide consumers with a copy of their receipt in order to file an emergency action against a potential identity theft or credit card fraud.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  On March 12, 2019, the court granted a motion by the SEC for a preliminary injunction and ordered the defendants to comply with the court's order.  A hearing is scheduled for May 17, 2019.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (March 26, 2018).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit in the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
