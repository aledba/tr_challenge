  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia today entered a final judgment in favor of Beverly Hills Porsche v. Universal Leather, LLC (Beverly Hills).  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia on May 2, 2016, Beverly Hills allegedly engaged in business dealings with a Virginia-based car dealership based in Virginia.  The complaint alleges that Beverly Hills contacted the dealership through its website, kicking off remote negotiations by phone, email, and text message.  Beverly Hills agreed to the purchase of a used car with a certified pre-owned warranty, and the dealership agreed to pay $37,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Beverly Hills for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the complaint, the SEC has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Beverly Hills from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and a $20,000 officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Virginia Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Virginia Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
