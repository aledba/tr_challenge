  "summary": "On May 23, 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against San Francisco-based AT&T, Inc. (\"AT&T\"), a California-based telecommunications company, for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Francisco, California, alleges that, from at least 2007 through 2010, the City of San Francisco approved a $1.2 million project to construct 726 new utility cabinets on public right-of-way.  According to the complaint, the project was supposed to be a \"limited number\" of new, small, and high-density, residential utility cabinets.  However, the complaint alleges that the project did not meet the criteria for a categorical exemption, and that the city failed to adequately consider the impact of the project on the environment.  In its final judgment, the court found that the proposed project violated the federal anti-fraud laws, and ordered the city to develop appropriate mitigation measures.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, the city consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal, state, and municipal securities laws, orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,500, and orders the company to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $100,000, and imposes a $75,000 civil penalty.  On May 24, 2011, the Honorable Judge Robert J. Burt of the Umpqua Regional Office granted the Commission's request for a temporary restraining order against the proposed addition of additional utility cabinets to the city's public right of way.  Burt has agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations, to pay an $80,000 penalty, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  A hearing on May 25, 2011 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. for the Commission on Environmental Quality and a hearing on June 5, 2011 for the District Attorney's Office of Northern California.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the San Francisco Regional Office. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Environmental Quality, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Office of Inspector General."
