  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was found guilty of second degree murder in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that on November 20, 2012, Robert Lee Heard, Jr., of Opelousas, Louisiana, stabbed his wife, Demetra Doyle, multiple times, which resulted in her death. According to the complaint, the woman was unhappy with her marriage, had no intention of getting a divorce, and was packing to leave her husband's home the night of the murder. The complaint further alleges that Demetrata had no intentions of getting married and had no plans of getting divorced. Instead, she was unhappy in the marriage, mentioned other men's names, and may have been packing to go. The court denied the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction and, thereafter, sentenced him to a mandatory life sentence without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence.  On August 24, 2017, the court issued a temporary restraining order and issued an order freezing the assets of the defendant and ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Heard. The SEC is continuing its investigation into the matter. The case has been supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, and Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Louisiana State Attorney General's Office, and the Louisiana Department of Criminal Justice."
