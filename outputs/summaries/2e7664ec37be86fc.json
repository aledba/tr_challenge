  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Christopher T. Fowler, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 82 months in prison for possession of child pornography.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, on June 14, 2016, Fowler pled guilty to one count of receipt and distribution of child porn, which is a form of pre-judgment judgment that imposes a penalty of $5,000.  The complaint alleges that, as part of his supervised release, Fowler violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Fowler.  On May 21, 2019, the court issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order against Fowler, ordering him to pay a $6,500 special assessment, and imposing a 36-month sentence for violating the terms of the supervised release.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Fowler consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, imposes a permanent injunction against future violations, and imposes an $8,500 penalty.  Fowler also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the order.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the New York Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Office of Inspector General, and the U.N. Office of Child and Family Education."
