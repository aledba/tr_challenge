  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Robert Ferrante, a New Jersey resident who was involved in an automobile accident in 2006.  The court found that, without informing the carrier of the settlement offer or the outcome of the litigation, Ferrantee was unable to collect on his underinsured motorist (\u201cUIM\u201d) policy.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Jersey on October 2, 2006, FerRANTe was in a motor vehicle collision with a tortfeasor who had a liability limit of $100,000 on his insurance policy. The complaint alleges that Ferrantez failed to inform the carrier that he was seeking UIM benefits and that he had entered into a high-low agreement that would limit damages to $50,000, notwithstanding a jury verdict. The court also ordered Ferrantei to give notice to the carrier on the eve of trial, when he had already settled the case. The SEC's order also requires insureds to provide timely and accurate information about any settlement offer and to inform their carriers of any prejudgment findings arising from the litigation. In a parallel action, the U.N. Department of Justice today announced that it has issued an order requiring insurers to disclose material facts about their claims to the court in order to determine whether they are prejudiced. In its order, the court also issued a temporary restraining order, which prohibits insurers from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and requires carriers to disclose their history of violations of the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws. In addition, the order requires insurers to notify their carriers at the start of litigation with a defendant. In this instance, the SEC found for the insured that he failed to disclose his prior dealings with the tortfeaselor at any point over years of litigation, including the lack of a jury trial during the prior litigation.  In a related case, the Appellate Division found for him that he violated Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17(b)(5) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Finally, the case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, David A. Kasper, and Amy C. Welshhans of the New Jersey Office of Insurance Regulation. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Wesselhhans. The case will be supervised by"
