  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania yesterday entered a final judgment against Lehigh Valley Hospital and LeHigh Valley Health Network, Inc. (collectively, the \"Hospital\") for negligence in connection with injuries Betty suffered while in the hospital for knee surgery.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia on April 12, 2012, Betty Shiflett suffered a serious fall from bed while recovering from her knee surgery in the Hospital's post-surgical unit. The complaint alleges that the hospital failed to adequately train its nursing staff on the use of fall prevention measures and failed to appropriately allocate damages to the Shifletts' claims.  The complaint further alleges that in Halper, the hospital's claims of negligence in failing to provide adequate fall protection for Betty were inconsistent with those of its own expert, who testified that she suffered a \"high risk for fall\" when she fell out of bed.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the hospital.  On May 24, 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a temporary restraining order, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $2,391,620, prejudgment interest of $75,000, and a civil penalty of $250,000.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Philadelphia Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Justice's Cyber Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
