  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against a Florida man accused of orchestrating an unlawful arrest and subsequent search.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Deputy Blake conducted an investigatory stop on J.C.'s home to conduct a curfew check one night, after midnight. According to the complaint, the deputy entered a search warrant for the home and observed open alcohol containers and a marijuana \"blunt roach\" cigarette within inches of the home. The complaint alleges that the deputy then entered the search warrant and conducted a search, which was conducted without probable cause and without reasonable suspicion. The court found there was no reasonable suspicion to make the arrest and seize the marijuana cigarette, the bags, or the marijuana. The judge granted the officer's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the search to be conducted by the court-appointed receiver of the case. The Court also granted the deputy Blake's motion for a preliminary injunction, which prohibits him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered him to comply with the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The order also prohibits Deputy Blake from conducting an officer-on-officer search, including without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the Florida Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against J. C. Pennington. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement in this matter."
