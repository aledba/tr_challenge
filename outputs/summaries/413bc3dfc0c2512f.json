  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment finding that the late husband, Dr. Robert McClendon (\u201cMcClendon\u201d), was personally liable under Section\u00c2\u00a06672 for over $4.3 million in penalties for the unpaid withholding taxes of his medical practice, Family Practice Associates of Houston.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Houston, Texas, alleges that, on or about May 11, 2009, McClendon, then a member of the board of directors of Family Practice, learned from the Internal Revenue Service that, as soon as the board discovered that the payroll taxes were unpaid, FPA stopped paying its creditors and vendors, as advised by counsel. The complaint further alleges that McClendon loaned FPA $100,000 to cover the unpaid taxes, which was just under the closing balance of $296,772.28 available in FPA's account at the end of July 2009. As alleged in the complaint, the Board of Directors of FPA subsequently discovered that, to avoid using any of the existing or future funds, he had made a loan to FPA for the purpose of paying its payroll taxes in May 2009.

FPA then turned over $250,000 in insurance proceeds it received on the insurance claim it filed for employee theft.  McClendon also filed a counterclaim against the board, adding him as a party to the action.  In its judgment, the court found that, contrary to the contentions contained in the Commission's finding, the defendant was not liable under \u00a7\u20196672 because he was not a responsible person and did not willfully fail to remit funds due to the Commission. The court also found that the defendant had the duty to provide an accounting for Family Practice's funds when he knew that the owed taxes were due, and that he had the responsibility to pay those unpaid taxes in the same manner as taxes.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and requires McClendon to"
