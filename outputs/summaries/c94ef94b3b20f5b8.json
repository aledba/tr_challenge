  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a California-based mother for her role in a child abuse and neglect case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that B.T. was placed in the care of a noncustodial parent in 2006 through Mississippi dependency proceedings.  According to the complaint, Nickolas's mother, who was incarcerated for five years on drug charges, was the subject of a prior detriment finding by a federal court that required the court to place the child in the custody of a parent who had been removed from custody in an earlier dependency proceeding.  Nickolas allegedly told a social worker that the W.'s hit him with an extension cord or belt and that he did not want to be placed with her.  In addition, the complaint alleges that when the court found that Nickolas was not in the best interests of the child, it placed him with his maternal aunt, Faith W., who was then living in Mississippi.  B&T's husband, who also lives in Mississippi, allegedly used the extension cord to hit Nickolas.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, the court did not consider placing the child with the parent unless it found that the parent had remedied the underlying issues that led to the prior dependency proceedings, maintained a parental relationship with the child and supported the child's care with family members during her incarceration.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint filed in the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi, B&t has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering her to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. The settlement is pending final approval by the court. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Mississippi Department of Health and Human Services, and the Alabama Department of Child and Family Services in this matter."
