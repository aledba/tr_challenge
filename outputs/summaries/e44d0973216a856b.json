  "summary": "On January 4, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment that granted Deidi Rodrigue a divorce without first finding that she was unable to pay her attorney's fees.  The court's order, which was entered on a temporary restraining order, ordered Deidi to pay $600 in alimony and $13,562.41 in pre-judgment interest.  On remand, the court found that Deidi failed to meet her burden of proving the McKee's factors and did not plead for the same amount of periodic alimony as she incurred in pursuing the first appeal.  Deidi's attorney, Michael Ratliff, agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the chancellor's findings.  In a second judgment, Deidi filed an amended complaint, this time against the chancellor, finding that the chancellor erred in his equitable distribution of the marital estate, (2) in his determination of alimony, (3) by not awarding Deidi attorney fees, and (4) in her capacity as an attorney.  Without admitting to these findings, the chancellor agreed to pay Deidi $600, which amounts to less than the amount of her alimony she incurred for both the original appeal and the current appeal, and to the payment of $1,112.66 in monthly child support, which Deidi received from her mother and sister for the purpose of paying the child support she incurred.   The final judgment, which is subject to court approval, orders Deidi and Mitch to pay all of the fees and expenses associated with pursuing the second appeal, including the mortgage, taxes, and spousal support.  It also imposes a $100,000 civil penalty against Deidi for her failure to comply with the court's orders.  Additionally, the final judgment requires Deidi, Mitch, and Deidi each to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, on August 31, 2012, the federal district court for the southern District of Mississippi entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Deidi from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Deidis to pay the civil penalty in the amount and amount of $50,000, plus interest and a $1 million civil penalty.  To settle the matter further, the judge agreed to the appointment of a receiver to determine the appropriate amount of mortgage payments owed to Deidi by the parties in the divorce proceeding.  As a result of the settlement"
