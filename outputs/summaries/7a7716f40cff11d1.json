  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against four Central American men accused of illegally entering the United States without their children.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in El Paso, Texas, alleges that, between July 2017 and November 2017, Blanca Nieve Vasquez-Hernandez, Elba Luz Dominguez-Portillo, Jose Francis Yanes-Mancia, and Natividad Zavala-Zavala were each apprehended by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) soon after entering the country from Mexico. According to the complaint, the defendants were separated from their children and separated from them by the government. The complaint alleges that the children were not bona fide asylum seekers and were not entitled to a fair trial. Instead, the complaint alleges, they were placed in the custody of the agency's Office of Refuge Resettlement (ORR) in the El Paso sector of CBP. The defendants were not permitted to return to their countries after their criminal convictions had been deemed satisfied by the court's finding that they had sufficient evidence to qualify for asylum under the federal criminal laws. The court also found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b)(1)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 13b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Defendants have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments in an investment in a real estate development project.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Citizenship and Immigration Services (CISIS) in this matter."
