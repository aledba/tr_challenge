  "summary": "On March 2, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky entered a final judgment against Lexington, Kentucky-based The Lexington Herald-Leader, d/b/a The Community News, Inc., a weekly four- to six-page non-subscription publication, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the City of Brentwood, Tenn., a town of about 100,000 residents in Fayette County, Kentucky.  In its judgment, the court found that the City violated its First Amendment rights by failing to consider alternative means of distributing written materials.  According to the court's order, the City has provided a reasonable basis to conclude that the Ordinance will reduce the amount of unsolicited written materials that are delivered to homes and driveways.  Without admitting or denying the Court's findings, the city consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins it from violating the First Amendment and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and orders the city to comply with a preliminary injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws.  On March 4, the Court granted the City's motion for a preliminary injunctive relief, granted the city's request for a court-ordered injunction, and ordered the City to provide an alternative method of distributing the materials to its residents.  As set forth in the order, however, the District Court's order does not require the city comply with the preliminary injunction, but instead requires that the city provide a sufficient basis to show that it has complied with the proposed injunction.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 206 (1949) and Litigation Alert No. 207 (1951).  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
