  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment against Bayou Bridge Pipeline, LLC, a Louisiana-based oil and gas company, and its owner, Harry Joseph, Sr., in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. James Parish, Louisiana, alleges that the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR) violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by issuing a Coastal Use Permit (CUP) for the construction and operation of a crude oil pipeline. The CUP is designed to safely carry 280,000 barrels or more of light or heavy crude oil per day from Lake Charles, Louisiana to various existing oil terminals located along the Gulf Coast. According to the complaint, DNR failed to consider the potential and real adverse environmental impacts of the pipeline, and instead issued the CUP without considering those impacts. The complaint alleges that DNR violated its public trust duty by failing to apply CUP to the proposed pipeline and failing to adequately consider the safety and emergency response of the affected communities.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants. The SEC also announced that it has obtained a temporary restraining order halting the construction of a second oil pipeline and ordering the DNR to conduct an emergency response. The court's order freezes the assets of the defendants and orders the destruction of any evidence that may have been obtained in connection with the alleged misappropriation of investor funds.  On May 2, 2017, the Honorable Kathleen M. Mascianica of the U.N. District Judge's Office in New York granted the SEC's request for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $100,000. The defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions, and orders them to pay civil penalties of $150,000 each. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The litigation will be led by Mr. McShane and Ms. Mancianica. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the UAW, the Louisiana Secretary of State's Office, and the Louisiana Attorney General's Office."
