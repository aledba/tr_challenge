  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against Spectrum Brands, Inc. (\"Spectrum\"), a company controlled by Cooper and Spectrum, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. Louis, Missouri, alleges that Spectrum, Cooper, and Spectrum violated Section 9 of the Exchange Act by failing to disclose to investors that the company was liable under Section 9 for remediation costs related to the Macon Site.  According to the complaint, Spectrum and Cooper agreed to pay $3,420,061.49 for response costs and $101,368.66 to settle the SEC's charges.  Spectrum also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a civil penalty of $160,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Spectrum.  On August 21, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Spectrum for violating Exchange Act Section 9 and Rule 9 and ordering Spectrum to pay civil penalties of $150,000 and $100,000, respectively.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, Spectrum consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of Exchange Act Rule 9, and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of any civil monetary penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Analysis and Detection Center (OIGC), with the assistance of the Division of Enforcement's Microcap Fraud Task Force (DSTF).  The litigation will be led by Andrew Perellis and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.  For additional information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17 (January 24, 2019)."
