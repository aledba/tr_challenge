  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Adam Libbey-Tipton, a convicted child molestation violator who was sentenced to 235 months in prison for disseminating child pornography.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that, in late 2014, the FBI obtained a search warrant to search the home of a Cleveland, Ohio man accused of accessing and viewing child pornography on the dark web. According to the complaint, the search was conducted with the assistance of a computer forensic specialist, and the case was supervised by a member of the FBI's CyberTipline team. The complaint alleges that the search resulted in the discovery of more than 400 images of child pornography, many of which were purportedly from a prepubescent girl who had been digitally penetrated by someone else's hand. The court found that the images did not belong to the defendant, but rather to his cousin, who was the subject of the search. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendant. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar.  In its order granting the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 235 months. The order also imposes a $75,000 civil penalty.  On March 4, 2019, the Court granted the SEC\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction, entered a default judgment, and entered an order suspending the search warrant. The Court also issued an order freezing the assets of the defendant and ordering him to surrender his passport and other documents related to the investigation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, however, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendant to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil monetary penalty of $75 million, and to be barred from serving as an officer and director of a public company. The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about how to spot and prevent child-pornography fraud, see CyberTrolls.gov/ChildPornography."
