  "summary": "The Kansas Department of Revenue (KDOR) today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting the administrative suspension of Brenda Rosendahl's driving privileges and finding the statutorily required $50 fee for an administrative hearing to challenge the suspension of driving privileges is unconstitutional.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas, alleges that, on December 12, 2015 at 5:35 p.m., a Miami County Sheriff's Deputy stopped a car that had been hit by a car while driving recklessly. According to the complaint, the driver had run off the road in or near her hometown so she had been exposed to the odor of alcohol coming from her breath. The complaint further alleges that the officer did not ask the driver if she had consumed alcohol post-driving. Instead, the complaint alleges that he simply asked her to drink from a half-pint bottle of \u201cHot Damn\u201d and she admitted to having one beer several hours earlier. The SEC also alleges that Bell failed to adequately consider the reasonable grounds for his suspension.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against RosENDahl.  On January 24, 2019, the U District Court in Kansas entered a final judgment against Rosendal, finding her liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, and ordered the officer to provide a copy of the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission's order, the officer consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $50 administrative hearing fee, and requires him to submit to a field sobriety test. The officer also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing is scheduled for May 26, 2019.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 13, 13, 244 P.3d 206. The Court of Appeals has issued an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue an officer-and-director bar. The receiver has agreed to the appointment of a receiver and to the payment of an administrative fee, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the receiver."
