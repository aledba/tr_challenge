  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho today entered a final judgment against defendant Martin Edmo Ish for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Pocatello, Idaho, alleges that Ish violated Section 17(a)(1) and (3) and Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and Section 15(a) of Rule 15a-3 thereunder and Section 16(b).  The complaint further alleges that, in a parallel action, the District Court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Ish from participating in future trials and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In its order, the court also granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Ish and ordered him to return to the district court for a hearing scheduled for April 12, 2017.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Ish consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 15a of the Exchange Act and Rule 16b-3, and ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interests, and to pay civil penalties of $1,000 and $100,000, respectively.  Ish also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Idaho State Attorney General's Office, and the Idaho Department of Justice in this matter."
