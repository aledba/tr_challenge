  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against a Kansas City, Missouri-based company for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 408 of the Securities Act of 1933.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Missouri, alleges that Newell Machinery Company Inc., a manufacturer of sweeteners and starches, failed to timely respond to a motion for a continuance of the company's pending contract with Pro Circuit, Inc.  According to the complaint, on January 22, 2016, Newell paid $87,424.70 under protest to Pro Circuit to remove a mechanical lien from its plant in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The complaint alleges that this payment was untimely because Newell had not conducted any discovery in the course of the project and that he did not have sufficient time to obtain a copy of the lien.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Newell.  On July 18, 2019, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of Newell's ill-gotten gains plus interest, and a civil penalty.  Newell has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 408, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his disgorgement plus prejudgment interest.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the federal district court for Jackson, the SEC seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, an officer-and-director bar, a penny stock bar and an officer and director bar.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, and the case was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Missouri Attorney General's Office and the Missouri Office of Financial Regulation."
