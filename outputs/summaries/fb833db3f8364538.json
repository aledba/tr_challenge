  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a Will County Sheriff's Department defendant who was found guilty of two counts of ineffective assistance of counsel.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, Dustin J. Lawson, of Will County, Illinois, was charged in December 2014 with one count of armed robbery and attempted murder.  The complaint alleges that, prior to trial, he had several altercations with a correctional officer from the housing unit where he was housed named Kevin McGrath who would tell other inmates about his case.  In one instance, the complaint alleged that defendant confronted him, displayed a knife, and demanded money from the cash register.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendant ran out of the store because he was unable to open the register and confronted the officer, who confronted him and confronted him about his actions.  After the trial court agreed to the settlement, defendant and his attorney agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay a civil penalty of 15 years and a $75,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, with the amount of their monetary penalties to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion by the SEC.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Chicago Regional Office by Michael J. Roddis and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
