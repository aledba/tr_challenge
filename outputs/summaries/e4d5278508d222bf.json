  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a former Uzbek citizen accused of providing material support to a terrorist organization.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, Colorado, alleges that Muhtorov, who was originally from Uzbekistan, made numerous false statements to the FBI in connection with his plans to join the IJU.  According to the complaint, he told his wife Nader Elhuzayel and two children that he would travel to Syria to join ISIS.  He also allegedly told his family friend that he was going to Turkey to support a \"pernicious\" group called the Islamic Jihad Union (IJU).  The complaint alleges that, contrary to these statements, he did not commit any such act of terrorism.  Instead, the complaint alleges, he encouraged others, including his wife, to join him in his efforts.  In a sentencing memorandum filed on July 18, 2018, the SEC's Office of Inspector General issued an alert about potential violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, Muhtarov consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of these provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, a $100,000 civil penalty, and a $50,000 officer-and-director bar.  Muhtar also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay disgorgement of $2,865 in ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $150,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Denver Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Gaunt, and the case is being supervised by Lara S. Mehraban. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the FBI, the U.K. Secret Service, and other emergency relief agencies."
