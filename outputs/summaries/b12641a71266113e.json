  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois yesterday entered a final judgment against Chadha for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that Chadha, a resident of North Park Elementary School, Illinois, purchased the property in 2008 for $225,000 with the intention to rehabilitate the structure on the property. The complaint alleges that, as a result of the property's destruction, Chadha was unable to acquire the property for the purpose of acquiring it. Chadha's complaint also alleges that the defendants engaged in a series of \"neighborhood nuisance\" complaints against the property, which resulted in the issuance of multiple complaints filed by the city and the alderman's office.  Chadha allegedly consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1.1 million and a civil penalty of $100,000. The judgment also prohibits Chadha from participating in any type of securities law enforcement activity, including securities laws violations, and prohibits him from participating as an officer or director of a public company.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  According to the SEC's continuing investigation, the case was handled by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Department of Insurance, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
