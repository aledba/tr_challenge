  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Robert Cardali and his firm, Robert A. Cardali Associates LLP, for defamation.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan on August 19, 2010, Cardali falsely claimed that he was a \"common criminal\" who would double bill unsuspecting clients.  The complaint further alleges that Cardali's firm hired outside counsel to do the work and billed the client for the lawyer's fee.  As alleged in the complaint, the complaint alleges that, in reality, the lawyer was not a common criminal, but rather a lowlife and a \"perjurer\" who was taking advantage of his clients. The complaint also alleges that the lawyer did not put up a billboard on the Brooklyn\u2013Queens Expressway or take an advertisement out in the New York Post.  Instead, he left a note for another attorney who worked for Cardali, telling the client that he would get one third of the net recovery in full satisfaction for all of his labor and the client would only receive $60,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, cardali consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $8,400, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $2,500.  In addition, the judgment orders Cardali to pay a $10,000 civil penalty, which is subject to the qualified privilege of a common interest of another attorney, and imposes a $50,000 bar on Cardali. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Brian Rinaldi and Glenn S. Gordon and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Mr. Gordon. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.
