  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maine today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was sentenced to a sixty-month prison term based on a finding that he was responsible for Gavin's death.  The court found that the defendant was liable for a substantial upward variance in the amount of fentanyl that he sold to Gavin.  According to the court's order, the defendant knew that the fentanyl in Gavin's system was a contributing and meaningful cause of his death, and that he had procured heroin for Gavin on two or three earlier occasions.  In addition, the court had before it a surfeit of reliable and relevant information, including a medical examiner's report, which determined that the drug was a significant contributing factor in the death. The court also found that, without proof that the substance he sold contained fentanyl, the appellant was liable to a penalty of up to sixty months.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $75,000. The defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of Section 3553(a)(1) and Section 3554(b)(2)(B) and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.
