  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment against Spokane, Washington, that permanently enjoins the city from violating the uniformity requirements of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, alleges that in 2004, the city of Spokane obtained voter approval for a citywide local property tax exemption to senior citizens and disabled veterans. The city initially planned to complete the projects over 10 years, then retire the bond under a 20-year retirement levy, a type of excess levy. The complaint alleges that, in 2014, the City of Spokane raised its regular property tax levy by $0.57 per $1,000 of assessed value, which was exempt from the state tax exemption.  In 2015, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled that the city had the power to grant the exemption to certain classes of persons who would qualify for the exemption. The court found that the exemption was not authorized under federal law, and that the City violated its ministerial duty to implement it.  On February 9, 2015, a federal district court in Spokane, Wash., entered a judgment against the city, ordering it to comply with the court's order, ordering the city to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and ordering the county to implement the tax exemption as well.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the district court agreed to the settlement. The settlement is pending final approval by the court. The case is being handled by John Rymas of the SEC's Market Abuse Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Wash. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Securities and Futures Task Force to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals and to determine whether they qualify for a tax exemption at the state level.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed an emergency action against Spokane County Assessor George Shipman, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Shipman consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the above-mentioned provisions, ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $150,000.  Shipman agreed"
