  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for orchestrating a string of string of failed jury trials.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Maryland, alleges that defendant Bruce Edward Pietruszewski, who was convicted of orchestrating an April 22, 2017 double-jurmur, attempted to convince a jury that he had the right to strike from the box, despite having been denied the opportunity to do so.  According to the complaint, the jury deliberated for less than an hour before deciding whether to grant the defendant's motion for a new trial.  In its judgment, the court held that the defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The court also granted the defendant a temporary restraining order, barring him from participating in jury selection, and ordering him to surrender his passport and other documents in order to obtain a court-issued copy of the court's order.  On May 4, 2019, the Honorable Judge Robert C. Hannan of the United States District Court in Baltimore entered a judgment ordering a permanent injunction against Pietruszbach, who had been previously convicted of the same felony.  Hannan also agreed to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 4-313 (b)(3).  The Court granted the defendants' motion for new trial on May 5, 2019. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Maryland Office of Criminal Investigations, and the Maryland Department of Justice in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of \"striking\" from the jury box, warning investors to be aware of any potential conflicts of interest."
