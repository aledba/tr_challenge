  "summary": "On March 16, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of South Carolina entered a final judgment against defendant Dean Arte Lampkin, Jr. for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b)(2)(A) and (c) thereunder of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Moncks Corner, South Carolina, Lampkin was charged as a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, in violation of the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of those securities laws, and with aiding and abetting and conspiracy to revoke Lampkin\u2019s supervised release.  The SEC alleges that Lampkin violated his due process rights by failing to provide sufficient evidence to conclude that he committed a Grade A or B violation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of twenty-four months in prison.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for South Carolina today announced criminal charges against Lampkin arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On March 17, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  Among other things, the complaint alleges that the district court violated its due process right to adequate notice by not requiring Lampkin to provide proof of his knowledge of the substance in the possession of the marijuana.  Specifically, it alleges that, after she drove to work, she let Lampkin use her Toyota so Lampkin could attend community service.  As alleged, however, none of the drug evidence, including the plastic baggies and the digital scale, was present in her vehicle before she allowed Lampkin borrow her car before she let him borrow it.  Further, the court found that the defendant had sufficient and valid reasons to revoke his supervised release because he lacked the requisite intent to distribute the marijuana, and that he had failed to provide adequate notice of his alleged violation by possessing the marijuana in the Walmart bag.   The court also found that, based on the facts presented at the revocation hearing, he did not have sufficient reason to revoke the defendant's supervised release, and the court did not err in concluding that the alleged violation was a federal felony.  Finally, the case was handled by Adrianna Span, who was also a co-defendant of the alleged"
