  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment in favor of a Pittsylvania County man who was injured while renovating a school building.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Richmond, Virginia, alleges that former students and interested individuals formed the Harvey School Historical Society in 2012 to raise funds for the school's construction and renovation.  According to the complaint, the Historical Society and its founder, Annie Mosby, engaged in an informal relationship that allowed the school to meet in the Church building. The complaint further alleges that Mosby hired an unlicensed contractor to construct the school building, William Johnson, a California resident, to do some or all of the work on the project. The SEC alleges that, despite having no construction experience, Mosby relied entirely on Johnson to plan and perform the work and did not exercise any control over Johnson or over any aspect of his working conditions.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Virginia today announced criminal charges against Mosby.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Jeffreys consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For additional information, see Litigation Release No. 522-3, 2017.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Johnson, charging him with violations of Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and aiding and abetting Jeffreys\u2019 violations of Rule 13a-14. The court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against Jeffreys.  An SEC order appointing a receiver to oversee the school will be instituted in a matter of days.  A hearing on the matter of the receiver will be conducted by the SEC and the SEC will be led by Mr. Rodriguez and Ms. Kelly.   The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Virginia Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Virginia Attorney General's Office in this matter."
