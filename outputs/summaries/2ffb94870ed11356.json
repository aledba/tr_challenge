  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment in favor of Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) in an emergency action to subrogate the benefits of a state trooper who was injured while on duty.  According to the court's order, on February 25, 2011, Pennsylvania State Trooper Joseph Bushta (\u201cClaimant\u201d) suffered a back injury that rendered him unable to perform his duties for 21 weeks when his police cruiser was rear-ended by a tractor-trailer. The court held that, under the Heart and Lung Act, an injured state trooper is entitled to a right of subrogation under the federal health and safety laws, and that, as a result of the accident, he was entitled to compensation in the amount of 66\u20132/3% of his or her average weekly wages.  The court also ruled that, in a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services (PennDOT) and the Pennsylvania Bureau of Workers Compensation (WBSC) violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The settlement is subject to court approval.  In its order, the court also ordered PSP to pay $98,895.18 as full payment of its workers' compensation benefits.  On November 13, 2014, the Commonwealth Court issued a judgment in Stermel v. City of Erie (Pa. Cmwlth. 2011) that, based on the facts of the case, requires the employer to pay the injured employee's full salary until he or she recovers from the work injury. The Court also ordered the company to reimburse the injured trooper's medical bills and other expenses incurred in connection with the same work injury, including vacation and overtime pay, for a period of approximately 16 months. The SEC's order also requires that the company pay a penalty in the form of $858.08, which is equal to the amount paid to the injured individual in the compensation claim.  As a result, the complaint alleges that, pursuant to the federal law, a self-insured public employee may be entitled to receive compensation in lieu of the benefits paid to him or her by the employer. The complaint also alleges that the employer has a right to reimbursement from the supersedeas fund for the portion of the compensation paid to"
