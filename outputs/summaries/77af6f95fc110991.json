  "summary": "On January 23, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment finding that B.S., a convicted felon, was a presumed father of L.L., a 10-year-old girl, pursuant to Family Code Section 7611, subdivision (d).  The court also found that, contrary to the court's finding, B. S. was not required to live with his mother or father in order for him to qualify as a \" presumed father\" under the federal law.  In its judgment, the court found B.s. was a \"murderer\" who had been incarcerated for years and failed to show he had a strong relationship with the child.  According to the judgment, in addition to failing to show a relationship with his own child, the defendant failed to demonstrate a \"strong relationship\" with the children.  The judgment also finds that, at the time of the contested hearing, he had not had any contact with his children since 2011, when he was sentenced to 12 years in prison.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the court, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the parties.  On February 24, 2018, a federal district court in San Diego entered a temporary restraining order halting the defendants from further violating the federal securities laws, ordering the defendants to return to their respective homes, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty against each of them. The court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the charged provisions, and ordered the defendant to pay a civil penalty of $20,000.  A hearing scheduled for February 26, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. for a hearing on the merits of the case. The hearing was conducted in the absence of any evidence to support a finding of detriment to the child, and the defendants were not permitted to participate in the hearing. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the San Diego Regional Office.
