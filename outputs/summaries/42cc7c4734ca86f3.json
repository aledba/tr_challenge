  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Live Nation Worldwide, Inc. (\"Live Nation\"), a Chicago-based entertainment venue operator, for failing to adequately protect concertgoers from alcohol-related injuries and deaths.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that Live Nation violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Live Nation, as a matter of law, had no duty to prevent the death of Megan Elam, who was a passenger in a car driven by an intoxicated friend after a concert.  Live Nation also failed to adequately supervise and monitor concertgoers while they were intoxicated.  In addition, the complaint alleges Live Nation failed to provide sufficient security at the concert to prevent Megan from driving off the premises while under the influence of alcohol.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed on August 13, 2011, a federal district court in Illinois granted summary judgment in favor of Live Nation and ordered it to pay $10,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of the defendants' ill-gotten gains plus interest.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC in the complaint filed in the case, LiveNation consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to disgorge its alleged liability with respect to Megan's death.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Chicago Regional Office by Michael J. Bogenberger and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Bigenberger. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Police Department, the Illinois Department of Insurance, and the Illinois State Corporation Commission on the Securities and Exchange Commission's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy."
