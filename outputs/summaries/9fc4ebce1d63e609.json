  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment in favor of a motion for a temporary restraining order against a Florida man accused of orchestrating a triple-murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that on December 5, 2014, the trial court denied a defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal on the basis of insufficient evidence and circumstantial evidence.  According to the complaint, the jury was told that the defendant had the burden of proving his guilt beyond and to the exclusion of all reasonable doubt. The complaint further alleges that, after the jury deliberated for approximately ten minutes, the defendant allegedly told the jury that he \"wanted his money back\" and that \"today is the deadline.\"  The complaint alleges that the jury found the defendant guilty on all of these counts and that he was entitled to a new trial based on the evidence and evidence presented to the jury.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Florida today announced criminal charges against Talley for his role in the triple murder.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the court granted the defendant's request for an emergency restraining order, ordered a retrial, and appointed a receiver for the receiver of the receiver's receiver. The receiver was not immediately available for comment.  On January 2, 2020, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the receiver, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the receiver has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and requires him to be barred from the securities industry for a period of five years, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest of $2,500.   The receiver has also agreed to be permanently enjoined from associating with any person who has a history of drug or alcohol-related criminal conduct, and from participating in any offering of a penny stock or offering of any penny stock at any time. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Pollock and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Miami Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of the Attorney General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Florida Department of Justice in this matter."
