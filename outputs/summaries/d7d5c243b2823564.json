  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Lubbock National Bank, a former trustee of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), for its alleged violations of fiduciary duty under the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, filed on September 11, 2017, filed a valuation of TBM Consulting Group, Inc. (TBM) that relied heavily on financial projections prepared by Anand Sharma 2009 GRAT Trust and Lotus One, LLC (collectively, the \"Sharma parties\").  The complaint alleges that, in preparing its valuation report for TBM, TBM and Stout relied on these projections, which were inconsistent with the trajectory of actual financial performance for the Sharma parties' shares.  In addition, the SEC alleges that Stout and TBM engaged an independent valuation consultant, David Johanson, to perform a valuation and provide a fairness opinion concerning the consideration to be paid by the ESOP for those shares, and that Johanson aided and abetted TBM's violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Stout has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions and orders him to pay disgorgement of $10,500,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-cv-02391 (Feb. 23, 2019).
