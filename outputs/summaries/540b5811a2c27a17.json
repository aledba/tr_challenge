  "summary": "On September 5, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a Boone County, Arkansas woman for her role in an aggravated robbery and murder of Jeremy Scroggins.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas, alleges that, from at least June 27, 2016 through June 28, 2016, Shay Butler, of Boone, Ark., told a live-in boyfriend that he was going to pick up Scruggins and beat him up and take anything he had on him, including a.22-caliber pistol. According to the complaint, Butler also allegedly told the girlfriend that he had a gun and that he planned to use a gun to take anything from Scrobins. The complaint further alleges that the girlfriend allegedly told Butler that she had seen the gun in Butler's possession and that she was afraid he had used it to commit the robbery.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Arkansas today announced criminal charges against Butler. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Butler, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting Butler's violations of Section 13(a) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Butler consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5-2-403 (Aug. 2, 2017).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Lamornay, and the case will be supervised by Mr. Gibson. The case has been supervised by B. David Fraser."
