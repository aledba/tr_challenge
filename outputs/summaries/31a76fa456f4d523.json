  "summary": "On January 27, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment against the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Department of Homeland Security in an emergency action related to the travel ban.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that President Donald J. Trump issued Executive Order 13,769 (EO-1) in January 2017, which temporarily suspended the entry of some or all of the above-mentioned individuals from seven predominantly Muslim countries.  According to the complaint, the executive order violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the Executive Order violated the anti-fraud provision of Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and that it violated Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product or service, including the right to reapply for a visa upon request of the court.  Additionally, the court entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of Section 12(b).  The court also granted a preliminary injunction against the Defendants from further violating the above provisions, and issued an order suspending them from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of a case-by-case review.  On February 5, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the District Court's request for a temporary injunction and ordered the defendants to comply with the court's order.  Separately, on February 13, 2019, a federal district court in Miami, Florida entered an emergency order halting the issuance of the EO-2 travel ban, ordering the suspension of the previously-issued executive order, and ordering the destruction of any evidence that may have been obtained in connection with the alleged violations. The court granted the relief sought by the Defendants to be granted by the court without prejudice, without prejudice to the Defendants, and with the assistance of the United Kingdom Secretary of State's Office. The Court granted the Defendants' request for an emergency court order suspending the issuance and sale of the executive orders."
