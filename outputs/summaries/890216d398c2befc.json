  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against a Florida man who was sentenced to prison for two felony counts of burglary of a structure causing damage in excess of $1,000.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that, in 2014, the defendant pled guilty to four felony counts and was subsequently sentenced to a total of 79.80 months in prison.  According to the complaint, in 2018, after serving three years in prison and beginning his probation on four additional felony counts, the court found that the defendant had committed a third-degree felony in four of those four cases, and that he had entered a plea to a Level 8 felony without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2014 the defendant entered a guilty plea to three felony counts in four separate felony cases, which he was later sentenced to, and was later found guilty of, driving with a suspended license as a habitual offender.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 921.0022(2)(d) and 10(e) of\u00a0the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 17a-1 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  On May 2, 2019, the U. S. District Judge in Orlando granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws, and ordered the defendant to pay a $75,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer-and-director bar.  A hearing for the defendant was scheduled for June 5, 2019.   The court also granted the defendant\u2018s motion for a hearing on June 9, 2019 and a hearing scheduled for May 10, 2019 on June 13, 2019 for the sentencing of the defendant on each of the 2018 felony counts. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Department of State Office of Criminal Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Office of Inspector General in this matter."
