  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Connecticut yesterday entered a not guilty plea in a civil injunctive action against a Vernon man accused of causing a serious injury to his daughter.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Hartford, Connecticut, alleges that, on January 9, 2015, the defendant and his daughter, V, were confronted by a caregiver who held her face while she suctioned mucous from her nose.  According to the complaint, V's mother, Danielle Mailloux, told the caregiver that the defendant \"grabbed her face hard to keep her head still\" and \"tried to suction her nose with a bulb syringe to get the mucous out of her nose.\"  The complaint alleges that V was fussy because she was suffering from a cold and had received vaccinations two days earlier.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, that defendant intentionally held V's face while suctioning her nose, and that he did not know that he was squeezing her face too hard.

District court for the Central District of Florida, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.
