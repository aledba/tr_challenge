  "summary": "On August 23, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut entered a final judgment against Connecticut's Department of Consumer Protection (DCP) and its Director of Licensing and Market Intelligence for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that the DCP and DLP violated the preemption provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Connecticut's Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The complaint also alleges that DLP and DCP violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and that, as a result of the DLP's actions, DLP was preempted by \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act.  DLP is not preempted, as the complaint alleges, because it requires wholesalers to post and hold prices for a specific product at the same time as the wholesaler.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering DLP to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against each of them.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  According to the SEC's continuing investigation, which is continuing, the litigation will be led by Janet C. Hall and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Connecticut Department of Commerce, and the Connecticut Division of Liquor Control (DLC) in this matter."
