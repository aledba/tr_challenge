  "summary": "On July 5, 2018, the Pennsylvania State Employees' Retirement System (SERS) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania alleging that the hearing officer and Board improperly held Decedent to a higher standard of proof than required by law.  According to the complaint, the board's order was issued on July 4, 2017, and the court entered a temporary restraining order against Decredent.  The complaint alleges that the board violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5705 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its order, SERS agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the Board from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to expedite the processing of the final judgment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's order, the Board agreed to a permanent injunction and to the appointment of a hearing officer to determine whether to grant the motion for a preliminary injunction and order the payment of the remaining $66,000.00 death benefit.  On July 7, 2016, the court granted the Board's motion for an emergency restraining order and ordered the hearing to conduct a review under the substantial evidence standard, which requires a reasonable mind to detect whether a person has a history of misconduct and a reasonable basis to make a determination about whether the person has committed a felony or a civil penalty.   The hearing officer also agreed to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as a witness in a case involving a defendant who has been convicted of a felony and sentenced to prison for a total of 17 years. \u00c2\u00a0The hearing officer, however, was not required to present expert witness evidence of the nature of the defendant's misconduct.  Rather, she was required to provide testimony from a handwriting expert or other scientific or conclusive proof establishing that the defendant had a volatile relationship.  She also was required not to take judicial notice of an altercation that led to the filing of criminal charges against Connors.  As a result of this, the order issued by the court prohibits the Board and SERS from conducting any forensic examination of a person's signature.  For further information, see Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services v. Connors, Inc., No. 17-cv-01221 (1942).  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Thomas K. Hamilton.  A hearing officer will be appointed as a receiver of the court's order."
