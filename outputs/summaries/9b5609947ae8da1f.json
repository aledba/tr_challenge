  "summary": "On May 11, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky entered an order granting the family court's motion to modify child support for Travis Wilson, a Kentucky dentist who lives with his wife and two children from a previous relationship.  According to the court's order, Wilson agreed to pay $4,000 per month in child support.  The court also granted Wilson\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered that Wilson pay $1,600 per month of child support in the amount of $867.00 per month.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Wilson.  Wilson has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $2,400 civil penalty.  On May 13, the court issued an order suspending Wilson from appearing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering him to comply with the court order.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, Wilson has consented to a permanent injunction, to the appointment of a receiver, and to an officer-and-director bar.  He has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Kentucky Department of Health and Human Services, and the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  For example, the SEC previously issued an Investor Alert alerting investors to the dangers of overcharging for child support based solely on the number of children in their family.\u00c2\u00a0In a separate SEC case, the Department of Justice announced that it had obtained an order temporarily restraining Wilson from participating in any investment that may be made in a company that does not meet the minimum set forth in the investor alert\u00c2\u00a0institutions. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Bowling Green, Kentucky, charges Wilson with violating Section 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10"
