  "summary": "On May 10, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi entered a final judgment against Robert S. McGilvary, a convicted felon who was sentenced to five years in prison for aggravated stalking.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Petal, Mississippi on May 9, 2018 in Forrest County, Mississippi, McGilvary told Heather Morgan that he wanted to build a house on a hill to put Morgan in so that he could always watch her.  The complaint further alleges that, after learning that Morgan had cut his hair for the first time in 2008, he came to the salon to bring Morgan change for her to take with him on vacation.  As alleged in the complaint, the complaint alleges that after this first visit, McGillvary began following Morgan around the salon, often showing up at the salon and asking to see Morgan.  In a parallel action, on September 27, 2017, a federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi entered an order permanently enjoining McGilkary from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of five years and a $75,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, McGilvy consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance of any officer-and-director bar in the future. The judgment also orders him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Mississippi Department of Corrections, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Mississippi State Department of Banking and Securities."
