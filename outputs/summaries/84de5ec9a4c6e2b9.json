  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Orleans today entered a final judgment against Touro Infirmary, Inc., a New Orleans-based acute care hospital, on the basis of its failure to adequately prepare for Hurricane Katrina.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that Touro's former CEO, Lionel Favret, Jr., and his wife, Lynda Hannie Favret (collectively referred to as \"Mrs. Favret\"), made false statements to the SEC regarding the emergency preparedness plans Touro had prepared for the storm.  According to the complaint, Favret's injuries were exacerbated by prolonged sitting in a wheelchair, prolonged exposure to the heat, and a lack of adequate emergency medical supplies.  As alleged in the complaint:  Touro did not have a written evacuation plan and its emergency plan did not meet any applicable standard of care.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Favret was not adequately prepared to evacuate because of the condition of the hospital's premises and the fact that he had to sit in a van for eight to ten hours during his evacuation.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Touro agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Touro to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Additionally, the court granted Touro a temporary restraining order, which prohibits it from issuing or selling any security or other emergency relief materials, and ordered it to pay an officer and director bar and a $100,000 civil penalty.  On November 16, 2011, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking summary judgment, a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and the return of injured patients to the hospital.   In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Louisiana today announced criminal charges against Favret. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
