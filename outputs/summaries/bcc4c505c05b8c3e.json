  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that the Secretary improperly exceeded his statutory authority in setting the 2018 and 2019 340B reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceutical drugs.  According to the complaint, the Secretary misappropriated and misused information about the drug reimbursements from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).  The complaint further alleges that, contrary to the Secretary's representations to the Commission, the CMS violated the federal securities laws by not requiring the reimbursement rate to be determined by the Commission.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, the SEC has agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining the Secretary from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the Exchange Act, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his disgorgement plus prejudgment interest thereon.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order appointing a receiver to determine the appropriate timing and manner of remediation for certain 340B drug reimbursement rates that the Commission previously ruled unlawful.  On August 5, 2019, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order requiring the Secretary to comply with a court order requiring him to respond to a request for an emergency court order.  To learn more about how to apply for a court-ordered injunction, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Feb. 26, 2019).  In its order, the Commission issued a Notice of Intent (DOI) to encourage the Commission to consider the merits of this action, including whether it is reasonable to expect a court to rule against the Commission in this matter.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Scott A. Mascianica of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Postal Inspection Service, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency."
