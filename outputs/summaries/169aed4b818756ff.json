  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a clerical worker who sought workers' compensation benefits based on her alleged exposure to mold.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Orleans, Louisiana, Angela Douglas Lyle, a former clerical employee at the Valero plant in Norco, New York, claimed that from the beginning of her employment, she observed mold throughout the trailer on air vents, window sills, ceiling tiles, and baseboards. The complaint alleges that over time, the amount of mold and fungal spores in the office caused her to lose her hearing.  The complaint further alleges that Lyle's hearing loss was a result of her exposure to the mold and/or fungus in the trailer.  In its judgment, the court found that, as a matter of law, the nature of the work performed in determining whether an employee has an occupational disease does not fall under the scope of the LWCA.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Lyle consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Lyle also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a $100,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael O'Regan and Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Orleans Office of Health and Human Services, and the Louisiana Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
