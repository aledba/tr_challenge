  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against Gerald Lynn Allen, Jr., a convicted felon, for his role in a 2017 Saginaw, Michigan domestic violence case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Michigan on April 21, 2017, Allen was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC alleges that Allen violated the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws by failing to provide sufficient evidence to support his claims that he was liable for a fair trial when, in fact, he was not.  Allen also was found liable for failing to call as witnesses the two physicians who treated the victim, Dr. Hicks and Dr. Defriez, as witnesses.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Allen.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Burt of the Federal Bureau of Investigation entered final judgments against Allen that permanently enjoin him from violating the charged provisions, ordered him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordered Allen to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Allen consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged sections of the securities laws, ordering him to disgorge $10 million in prejudgment interests, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty.  Judge Burt granted Allen's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered the destruction of documents, and issued an order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to be restrained and restrained from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged conduct of the defendant.  A hearing for Allen is scheduled for May 26, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (2014).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Ericksen, Patrick Busch, and Ms. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office, with assistance from John Rymas of the Division of Criminal Justice and the Office of the Attorney General's Assistant Chief of Criminal Investigations.   The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Mr."
