  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Waterbury man who was convicted of drug-related charges.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges that, on August 14, 2015, Officer Scott Phelan of Waterbury, Massachusetts, conducted an undercover operation on the porch of a multi-level home in Waterbury. The complaint alleges that the defendant, whom the complaint alleges had warrants for his arrest, entered and exited the house through the front door of 126\u2013128 Walnut Street. According to the complaint, the defendant allegedly used the porch as a hiding place to hide from the officers, and the officers followed him through the house and through the back door. The SEC alleges that this conduct violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Section 15(a) and Rule 15a-1 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On August 16, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the U.N. Division of Justice issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering the investigation to be conducted by staff in the Division of Enforcement's Cyber Unit. The case was supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Cyber Unit, with the assistance of Assistant Chief David A. Basinger. The litigation will be led by Mr. Sousone."
