  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Starbucks Corp. (\"Starbucks\") for violating the company's meal period policies and practices.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that, from at least August 2013 through December 2013, Starbucks violated the federal meal period laws.  According to the complaint, as a result of these violations, Starbucks was required to provide employees with meal period premiums when they worked longer than five hours without being provided a meal period.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Starbucks failed to provide timely meal period premium payments to employees who worked more than five hour shifts without providing it.  As a result, Starbucks is required to pay a premium for each meal period it provides to its employees.  For example, in one instance, Starbucks allegedly provided employees with a 30-minute meal break but did not provide them with a meal-period premium.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Starbucks consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, imposes a $150,000 civil penalty, and bars it from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the San Diego Regional Office, and is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Workforce Development, and the California Office of Inspector General in this matter."
