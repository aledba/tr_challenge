  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri today entered a final judgment in favor of the insurance companies in a civil injunctive action brought by Megan and Chad Roberts against each of them.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, on December 12, 2008, Megan and her husband Chad Roberts, while riding as a passenger in a vehicle operated by Chad Roberts and American Family Insurance Company of Wisconsin, raised the issue of whether or not to stack the UIM coverage and medical expense coverage in the insurance policies.  According to the complaint, the court found that, under Illinois law, the amount of insured motorist coverage in a policy does not stack with the amount paid by other insurance companies.  In addition, as alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants' insurance policies do not stack and do not allow for a reduction in the amount that the insurance company pays to the insured.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, Inc. (\"Advisers\").  The court also granted the defendants a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from further violating the anti-stacking provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.    In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Missouri Secretary of State's Office, and the Missouri Attorney General's Office in this matter."
