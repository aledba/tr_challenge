  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Kansas today entered a final judgment in favor of Kansas-based Peddler, LLC and its owner, Roy Karon, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas, alleges that Karon and Karon violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Karon agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  Karon also agreed to pay $100,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Karon.  On January 9, 2018, the Honorable Judge Robert L. Haig of the federal district court for the Central District of Iowa issued a temporary restraining order, freezing Karon\u2019s assets, and ordering Karon to surrender his passport in order to obtain a court-issued copy of the complaint and to pay a $50,000 civil penalty in the amount of $1.8 million.   The court also issued an order suspending Karon from participating in the issuance, purchase, sale, or sale of any securities in any state, for a period of three years.  This order is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 13, or No. 17-cv-11, (January 24, 2018).  The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kansas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kansas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
