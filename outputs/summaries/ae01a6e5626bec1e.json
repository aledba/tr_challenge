  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against the property owners of Houston, Texas, who are seeking to have the city of Houston permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the Property Owners, who allege that they failed to exhaust their administrative remedies in their response to the City's denial of the property's non-conforming status to the ZBA.  According to the court's order, filed on September 27, 2016, the property owner, Yoram Ben-Amram, filed a second plea to the jurisdiction, alleging that the city violated Section 29-111(a)(4) and Rule 29-112 thereunder, and failed to timely respond to the Commission's request for an injunction.  In a parallel action, the Texas Secretary of State's Office today announced that it had filed an emergency action to halt the city's violations of the federal securities laws, and that it would seek a court-ordered injunction, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the properties' losses.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations, and orders them to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000 and a $100,000 civil penalty, and requires them to submit an application for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 29,111(b)(4).  The Court also granted the property Owners' motion for an emergency injunction, which is subject to court approval.  On October 17, 2016 the Commission issued an order granting the property ownership's motion for new trial, which was overruled by operation of law.   The Commission's order granted the request for a temporary injunction, and the Court granted the properties owner's request to request an emergency court order, ordering the asset freeze and other emergency relief to be instituted immediately. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Texas Department of Commerce, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Houston Police Department and the Texas Office of Inspections and Examinations."
