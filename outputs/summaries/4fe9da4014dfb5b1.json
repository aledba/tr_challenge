  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Mario Roberto Guevara Diaz, who was convicted of two counts of second-degree rape and a third-degree felony.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that the trial court did not adequately oversee the juror selection process or conduct an independent inquiry before allowing a defendant to be fair to both sides in a case involving allegations of sexual assault or sexual abuse. The complaint also alleges that, as a result of this conduct, the jury pool was not adequately represented to the court as to whether or not a defendant could be fair and impartial. The SEC alleges that jury selection was not conducted in the court's supervision and on the record, and no one questioned juror 23 about her bias. The court also ruled that the jury selection process was not sufficiently supervised by the court and that the defendant could not be fair. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against one of the defendants.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed today in federal district court in Manhattan, Judge Richard G. Currid granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar, and a conduct-based injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $100,000. The jury selection hearing was conducted by Assistant Chief of the Division of Criminal Justice, and the case was supervised by Amy C. McKinley. The litigation will be led by David A. Kasper and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Police Department, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice Criminal Division, the Office of the Attorney General and the Federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission."
