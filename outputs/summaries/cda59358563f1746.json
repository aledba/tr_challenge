  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Texas today announced criminal charges against a Texas mother and her abusive ex-boyfriend in connection with their alleged domestic violence.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, alleges that Vicky M.N., a resident of El Paso, Texas, and her husband, Cory S. Welshhans, engaged in a series of abusive and physically abusive relationships with two children.  According to the complaint, Vicky and Larry were involved in multiple instances of domestic violence that resulted in the termination of Vicky\u2019s parental rights.  Vicky allegedly engaged in multiple relationships with men who engaged in domestic violence, including Larry, who was also a convicted felon.  In one instance, the complaint alleges that Larry was physically and mentally abusive, and he frequently pushed, choked, and yelled at the children while Vicky was in his care.  Larry also allegedly had a history of physical and mental abuse.  On one occasion, Larry was arrested for domestic violence and Vicky refused to leave the home and the children were placed with Larry.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, when Vicky returned to pick up the children, she was confronted by Larry and told that she did not have any excuse for not keeping the children with her.  She also allegedly told Larry that she had detached from O.E.R. following the injury to her daughter and that the child had fallen off the couch.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Larry agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to be prohibited from associating with any person who has committed a serious felony or other conduct with a child in violation of Section 161.001(b)(1)(D).  The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (January 21, 2019).  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney\u2019S Office for Texas today filed criminal charges in the District of Columbia against Vicky for her role in the alleged conduct.  A hearing is scheduled for March 5, 2019.   The case is being handled by David J. Burt and Eric R. Werner of the Fort Worth Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Department of Children and Family Services, and the Texas State Attorney General's Office."
