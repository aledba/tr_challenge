  "summary": "On October 26, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Ultra Petroleum Corp., a holding company, and its two subsidiaries, UUP Energy Corporation and Ultra Resources, Inc., in an emergency action to restructure the company.  According to the court's order, filed on April 29, 2016, Ultra Petroleum and its subsidiaries voluntarily petitioned for reorganization under Chapter 11 under New York state law.  The court found that the reorganization plan was not impaired because it did not require the creditors to pay a contractual Make-Whole Amount or post-petition interest at the federal judgment rate.  In addition, the court ruled that certain creditors' contractual claims were impaired because the plan did not permit them to recover the claimed amounts.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay $400 million in disgorgement and $186 million in prejudgment interest, which is equal to the amount owed to them by the bankruptcy court in the alternative.   The judgment also prohibits the defendants from imposing civil injunctions, imposing a penny stock bar, and imposing an officer-and-director bar. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges the defendants with violating the anti-dealing provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and the reporting provisions of the federal bankruptcy laws, and seeks permanent injunctions and civil penalties against the defendants. The court also ordered the defendants to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay a civil penalty, and pay a $1,500,000 civil penalty.  On October 31, 2017, the Court granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order against further violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and ordered the parties to pay civil penalties in the amount of $4.7 million.
