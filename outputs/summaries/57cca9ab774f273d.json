  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered final judgments against Julia Realty, Ltd., a real-estate developer based in Warrensville, Ohio, against the Board of Tax Appeals for the District of Revision for tax year 2012.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio on April 1, 2013, Julia reaped the benefits of a court-ordered asset freeze and a temporary restraining order against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that, in its original complaint filed in the district court, Julia claimed that the auction-sale price constituted the true value of the property when, in fact, it was not at arm's length at the time the BTA issued its decision.  In its amended complaint, Julia alleges that it was entitled to a fair opportunity to present evidence and to receive a new hearing to determine the value of a property.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the amended BTA order, Julia has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,408,700.  Julia has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school for the remainder of the school year.   The final judgment also prohibits Julia from acting as an unregistered broker-dealer and from participating in the issuance of a second valuation complaint.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 13, and No. 1495 Jaeger, L.L.C. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, 2014-Ohio-4723, 23 N.E.3d 1086.  It also bars Julia from associating with any broker or dealer who has a conflict of interest with a defendant in a prior case.  Finally, the final judgment orders Julia to apply collateral estoppel in the case of tax year 2013 and 2014, and requires Julia to show that the property at issue was worth $1.408 million, which is the same as the value that was determined in the earlier BTA case. The court also ordered Julia to comply with an order appointing an independent receiver to determine whether a property is worth a certain amount of money. The SEC's investigation was conducted in the Office of Investor Education and the litigation was led by John R. Rymas. The case was supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry and Ms. Rammas."
