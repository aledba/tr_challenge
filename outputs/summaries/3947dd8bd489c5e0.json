  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Stephon Williams and Tyree Bennett.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that Williams and Bennett violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Mr. Williams and Mr. Bennett agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint. The complaint further alleges that, in September 2013, Williams pleaded guilty to a charge of aiding and abetting a drug-distribution conspiracy and was sentenced to 156 months' imprisonment. The SEC alleges that the defendants agreed to cross-examine each other and to market a cooperation-for-hire scheme to prison inmates seeking to reduce their prison sentences. The defendants also agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and requires them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia today entered an order granting the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 each. The court also granted the defendants the right to reapply for a hearing at a later date.  On May 2, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Williams, Bennett, and another defendant in connection with a related criminal case. The case is being handled by Mark W. McGraw and Eric R. Werner of the SEC Enforcement Division's Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Amy C. Welshhans and supervised by Marc J. Ricchiute.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.N. Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Georgia Department of Justice."
