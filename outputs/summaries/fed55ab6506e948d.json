  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a New Orleans-based property developer for failure to pay rent.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that Steven Anderson and his companies violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants sought to enforce a March 22, 2010 lease of a building located at 621 Religious Street that they contend Starboard owed pursuant to an April 2014 contempt judgment against Starboard. The complaint alleges that the defendants entered into a New Markets Tax Credit transaction to obtain a low market loan to refinance the existing debt on the property, and that the parties executed a lease agreement in March 2010. However, the court found that the lease was not enforceable and that Starboard failed to comply with the court's order.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Anderson and the Armbrusters.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 18, 2016, the trial court granted the defendants' motion for a new trial, which was subject to approval by the court. The court also denied the defendants a second assignment of error, ordering the court to consider the merits of the motion for new trial and ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $750,000. The Court also issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of an ongoing litigation and/or arbitration proceeding.  A hearing on June 24, 2014, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, the British Columbia Securities Commission, the U.K. Secret Service, and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority in this matter."
