  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against a Lowell man accused of orchestrating a series of string of string-and-a-half sexual assaults in the city.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Lowell, Massachusetts, alleges that, on August 23, 2015, a Lowell resident was attacked by a man in a red shirt and a pair of shorts.  According to the complaint, the victim confronted the man and told him to \"shut up.\"  The complaint alleges that the defendant replied, \"I'm not going to kill you.

The judgment also orders the defendant and the victim's attorney to jointly and severally disgorge their alleged monetary gains with interest in a civil monetary penalty of 12 years and a $10,000 civil penalty.
