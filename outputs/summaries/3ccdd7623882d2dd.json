  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Orleans today entered a final judgment in favor of the Succession of Doris Lavner Feingerts (Succession), dismissing his motion to annul the estate of his mother.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, from at least 2011 through 2016, Bruce Feingests, a New Orleans resident, made numerous misrepresentations to a trial court concerning his mother's will and testament, including that his mother had been unduly influenced into signing her last testament, and that her husband had possibly committed fraud.  According to the complaint, Mr. Feingsts also allegedly claimed that he had given his mother $103,313.01 from the estate, an amount he calculated as his naked ownership in the succession of his father.  In addition, the complaint alleges that he received a letter from his mother in 2001 stating that she had \"not let [Bruce] destroy her.\"  The complaint further alleges that on January 25, 2011, the trial court denied all of his requests for a continuance of the hearing on the family's motion for summary judgment.  On June 16, 2016, the court granted the executrix's request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, and granted the motion for a new trial.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $100,000 and a civil penalty of $75,000, and requires him to provide a copy of the judgment to a court-appointed receiver.  A hearing for the receiver of the estate is scheduled for May 24, 2016.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1167 (January 26, 2016).
