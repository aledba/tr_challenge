  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Eva Christian, who was found guilty of five felony charges related to an insurance-fraud scheme.  According to the court's order, Christian was sentenced to 18 months in prison for engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity.  The court found that, on a direct appeal of a criminal conviction, a defendant has no expectation of finality in the original sentence, and the trial court has the authority to impose a postrelease control term for the same offense after the defendant has completed his prison term for that same offense.  Christian's sentencing hearing was scheduled for August 26, 2014.  On August 27, 2014, the Second District Court of Appeals ruled that Christian violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, Christian consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal and state securities laws, and orders her to serve a total of nine years in prison.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Christian.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Columbus, Ohio, charges Christian with violating the anti-jurisdictional bar and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  It also seeks an officer-and-director bar and a penny stock bar. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Secretary of State's Office and the Ohio Department of Criminal Justice."
