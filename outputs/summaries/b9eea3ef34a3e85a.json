  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Michigan Interlock, LLC, a Michigan-based company that manufactures and sells Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Devices (BAIIDs).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Detroit, Michigan, alleges that the Michigan Department of State violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder, and that the Secretary of State unlawfully removed BAIIDs from the approved list of manufacturers.  The complaint also alleges that, in violation of the federal securities laws, the Secretary arbitrarily removed the BAIID manufacturers from the list.  According to the complaint, the SEC's order, which permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Michigan today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the securities law, ordering the destruction of any evidence, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $25,000.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  On August 28, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Kerstetter granted the SEC request for a preliminary injunction against future violations, ordering a hearing on the matter, and appointing a receiver to determine whether to proceed with the litigation.    The court's order also temporarily suspended the sale, purchase, installation, and sale of BAIIDS by the Department of Justice, and ordered the SEC to conduct an investigation into the matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Kasper and supervised by Marc Blau of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Attorney General's Office, and the Michigan Office of Inspector General."
