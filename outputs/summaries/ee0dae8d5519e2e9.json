  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Utah today entered a final judgment against Chad Jacob Roberts, Jr., a Utah man convicted of aggravated sexual abuse of a child.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that Roberts violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, from at least 2009 through 2011, Roberts engaged in a pattern of aggressive, aggressive, and unsympathetic conduct, including repeatedly stating that he would \"cuddle\" with Victim and would fall asleep in her bed with his penis pressed up against her buttocks.  In one instance, the complaint alleges that the prosecutor made improper statements during closing arguments about a DCFS investigation into allegations that she had been emotionally abusive to Victim.   The complaint further alleges that, in closing arguments, the defendant told the jury that he had \"cuddled up against [victim]\" and \"fall asleep\" in the bed with her.  He also allegedly claimed that, on the night in question, he had been \"pressed up against\" Victim's buttocks and \"pressed down against [her] butt.\"    In a parallel action, the Utah Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Roberts arising from the same conduct.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Roberts consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Salt Lake Regional Office, with the assistance of the Utah Division of Child and Family Services (DCFS).  The litigation will be led by John Rymas and supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the Division of Criminal Justice."
