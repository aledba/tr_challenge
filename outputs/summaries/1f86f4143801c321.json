  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a motion to dismiss by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) against a defendant for unlawfully delaying his or her visa application.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that, since at least May 2018, the U. S. Citizenship and Immigrations Services (CWS) has delayed processing of case-by-case visa applications for nationals of Iran, Libya, North Korea, Venezuela, and Yemen.  According to the complaint, the CWS has failed to determine whether a defendant is entitled to expedited processing of visa applications.  In addition, the complaint alleges that certain individuals have been denied visa applications because of family separations or because their visas had been suspended or revoked.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Additionally, the court entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants, freezing their assets, and barring them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security or public safety waiver.  On February 22, 2020, the Court granted the request for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws, entered an order appointing a receiver to oversee the issuance of the waiver, and appointed a receiver for the relief sought by the relief defendants.  To learn more about how to apply for a waiver, see Litigation Release No. 17-2001-RSWL-KSX, January 13, 2020.  For further information about the issuance and purchase of a security or safety waiver, visit http://www.sec.gov/waiver.htm.  Separately, the Department of Homeland Security today announced that it had obtained an emergency court order temporarily freezing the assets of certain of the defendants in connection with a related criminal case. The court also issued an order temporarily suspending the asset freeze pending final determination by the court on whether or not to issue an order suspending the defendants' visas.  A hearing on the matter is scheduled for May 24, 2020 to consider the merits of the proposed injunction.  An SEC hearing on May 26, 2020 is scheduled to be conducted by John R. Kelly and Glenn S. Gordon in the Denver Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom's Foreign Affairs Secret Service, the Swiss Financial Market Intelligence Service, and the Swiss Federal Office of Financial Intelligence."
