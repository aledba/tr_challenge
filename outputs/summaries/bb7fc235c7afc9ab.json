  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant in a child custody case against her.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, Erika M. (\"Ms. M.\"), a biological mother of seven children, and her putative father, Andre S. (\"Andre\"), filed a motion to vacate guardianship in 2007 or 2008 based on prior allegations of neglect.  The complaint alleges that Judge Geanopoulos, who was assigned to the case by the court, improperly granted the motion for substitution of judge as of right based on pre-judgment approval of the child protection order.  As alleged in the complaint, Andre and Ms. M., who had been previously assigned to child custody proceedings in 2007 and 2008, were neglected by their older sibling, Jac. S., and Ce. S.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's judgment, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Andre.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, and the Illinois Attorney General's Office in this matter."
