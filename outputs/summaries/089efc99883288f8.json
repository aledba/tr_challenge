  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Monica Mascorro, a Texas resident charged with capital murder for her role in Martin's death.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in McAllen, Texas, alleges that, on January 28, 2015, Martin's wife, Thelma Mae, was hospitalized and was later found dead.  According to the complaint, Martin asked Patterson to remove a piece of paper from his filing cabinet so he could check the financial condition of the deceased.  Martin allegedly told Patterson that he would use the money for his son's graduation party, flights to Las Vegas for four persons, a hotel room in Las Vegas, and miscellaneous restaurant expenses.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed criminal charges against Patterson, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Martin consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and from participating in any offering of a penny stock or investment in a publicly-traded company.  Additionally, the court granted the request for a temporary restraining order against Patterson and ordered him to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest in the amount of $36,464.76 that he received as a result of the alleged misconduct.  On February 24, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered Patterson to surrender his passport, and ordered McCole to comply with the court's order.  McCole also agreed to be enjoined from associating with any person who is not a party to a capital murder, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000 or more.   The settlement is subject to court approval.
