  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against the Boone County Housing Authority (BCHA) and Felicia Davis, a BCHA hearing officer, terminating her housing choice voucher benefits.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, in December 2015, BCHA terminated defendant Linda Kaye Johnson's benefits. According to the complaint, Davis was out of town in January when the agency terminated her benefits. The complaint alleges that Davis failed to timely respond to the agency's requests to terminate her benefits because she was unable to receive her mail for a period of time. In addition, Davis allegedly failed to inform the agency that she was in the process of losing her benefits and did not think to call the agency when she called to request a hearing.  In a parallel action, on March 14, 2017, the court granted BCHA's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Davis to comply with the court's order. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Davis consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar. Davis agreed to a permanent injunction and to pay a $75,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On March 21, 2017 the SEC filed a complaint against BCHA and Davis, charging them with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar from serving as an officer or director of a public housing authority. The court also ordered BCHA to conduct a background check on each of the defendants to determine whether they are competent to make a determination based on the evidence presented in the complaint. The case is being handled by Kristin Andrews and Christine Coon, with assistance from the Chicago office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The litigation will be led by Ms. Andrews and Ms. Coon and supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
