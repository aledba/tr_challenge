  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a defendant for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on March 4, 2015, Baldev Raj Bhutani was evicted from his condominium unit in 2013 by defendants, the Courts of Northbrook Condominium Association (Association) and the property manager, Lieberman Management Services (Lieberman), for failure to pay monthly property taxes.  The complaint alleges that the Association and Lieberman failed to timely respond to the defendants' requests for a temporary restraining order, a cease-and-desist order, and an asset freeze.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against the defendants, charging them with violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000.  On March 6, 2016, the trial court granted the defendants an emergency court order to halt the proceedings pending final approval of the court's order.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Attorney General's Office, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed an emergency action on March 5, 2015 against the Association and Lieberman, seeking a permanent injunction against future violations and a court order prohibiting them from issuing or selling any security or other security-related emergency orders.  This action was approved by the court on March 14, 2016 and the SEC on March 21, 2016."
