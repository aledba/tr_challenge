  "summary": "On March 24, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against New York State United Teachers, Inc., a New York City-based school district, and two other school districts, ordering them to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, Education Law \u00a72023\u2013a and the tax freeze legislation were designed with the legitimate goal of restraining onerous property tax increases that were believed to be depressing economic activity in the state.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of the challenged state law, school district budgets in 2012 and 2013 did not meet the statutory requirements for a tax credit, and failed to achieve the supermajority required by the state tax cap.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that school districts and their residents are not entitled to an income tax credit because they did not participate in the governance of their own schools.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $2.3 million, $100,000 in disgorgement, and $1,500 in prejudgment interest.  On March 26, 2019, the court granted the defendants' requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against them from participating in school district education decisions. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the New York Office of Education and the Division of Education's Office of Inspector General. The litigation will be led by John Rymas and supervised by Jennifer Chun Barry. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Education, and the State Corporation Commission in this matter."
