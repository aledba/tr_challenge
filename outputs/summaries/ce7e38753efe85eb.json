  "summary": "On July 19, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee entered a final judgment in favor of Neal & Harwell, PLC, a Tennessee-based law firm, against the firm's motion to disqualify him from representing a client.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Nashville, Tennessee on January 2, 2018 and unsealed on July 18, 2019, the SEC alleges that Tennessee's highest court found that a lawyer with interests adverse to a client of a law firm could be substantially involved in the representation of a client until shortly before a complaint was filed and then switch to a firm representing the client without consequence.  The SEC further alleges that the court's finding that the attorney who \"switched sides\" was not \"pending\" when the client was already represented by the client and therefore should be barred from representing the attorney in the future.  In addition, the court found no conflict of interest when the attorney joined the firm.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the Court found that the lawyer who \"witched sides\") was not required to be screened from all information related to the representation by the firm, and that he should be deemed fit to represent the client based on his familiarity with the matter.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Neal&harwell consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Neal &Harwell to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that will be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.  Additionally, the judgment orders Neal and Harwell to comply with the requirements of Rule 12b-20 of the federal securities laws, and requires Neal &harwell to provide a copy of the final judgment to any SEC-appointed receiver.  On August 2, 2019 the SEC filed a complaint against Tennessee Attorney General Derek J. Pyszka, alleging that he violated Rule 12a-20, and ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay a $1,000,000 civil penalty.
