  "summary": "On August 22, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against defendant Andrew Kolchins for breach of contract.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, from at least June through August 2012, defendant communicated with a representative of Evolutions Markets, Inc., a New York-based energy services firm, that he would like to receive a \"sign on bonus\" for work done prior to his termination.  According to the complaint, however, the representative of the company did not sign the contract and instead simply provided that the amount due to plaintiff as a \"Sign on Bonus\" would be determined by the amount of the bonus paid to the employee at the end of each contract year.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendant's June 15, 2012 email to Ertel stated that, because his employment ended before the contractual due date of the contract, he would receive a Special Non-Compete Payment of $750,000, payable in three installments, with $300,000 due within 10 days of the termination date.

Following the court's order, the SEC filed a civil action against defendant, alleging that, in violation of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 13(a)(1), that defendant violated Section 5, and that he violated Section 15(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rule 15a-14.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, the defendants violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder by failing to comply with certain of the provisions of the"
