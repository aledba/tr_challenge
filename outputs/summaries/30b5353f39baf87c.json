  "summary": "On May 17, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in open court on October 6, 2015, defendant Alfred Downing, who was convicted of possession of cannabis with intent to deliver, complained about his attorney's poor performance outside of court. The complaint alleges that defendant, who at the time was a Class X offender by background, claimed that he \"had no idea\" that his lawyer was facing a range of 6 to 30 years as a class X offender if convicted.  The complaint further alleges that defendants did not tell the trial court that they were going to trial and that he regretted the decision not to accept a plea bargain that would have given him three years of imprisonment.  As alleged in the complaint, defendant did not mention his lawyer's performance during the trial, and neither did the trial counsel.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Downing arising from the same conduct alleged in People v. Pecoraro, which was also investigated by the SEC.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in People, the court held that defendants had no duty to conduct a preliminary Krankel inquiry, and that the court had no jurisdiction to determine whether or not to conduct such an inquiry. The court also held that defendant had no right to raise the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel with a trial court, and therefore did not have the right to conduct an inquiry into the matter.  On May 24, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Downing, charging him with violations of the securities laws, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $5,000. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay of the Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The Office of Compliance and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Attorney General's Office in this matter."
