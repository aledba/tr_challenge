  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon today entered a final judgment against the Energy Facility Siting Council, a federal agency that administers the site certificate application process, finding that it violated the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Portland, Oregon, alleges that, from at least January 2017 through October 2017, the Commission issued a series of false and misleading statements to the Commission regarding the effectiveness of the proposed site certificate amendment process. Specifically, the complaint alleges that the Commission failed to adequately consider the importance of tracking the success of the new rules and failed to provide a sufficient basis for the Commission to determine whether the proposed rules were effective. The Commission also allegedly failed to inform the Commission that it was required to provide an expedited and/or full response to a request for an amended site certificate. In addition, as alleged in the complaint, the Council failed to timely provide a redlined document comparing the first and second draft of a site certificate to the then-existing rules. The complaint further alleges that in addition to failing to comply with the Commission's requirements for timely response to requests for a new site certificate, it failed to consider the impact of the Commission\u2019s actions on the Commission and its recommendations on how to proceed with the proposed rulemaking process.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the Commission. The SEC is continuing to investigate the Commission on Environmental Quality's (CEDQ) violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the Commission has issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the issuance and review of site certificate applications. The court will determine whether to issue an order imposing a civil injunctive relief order, impose an officer-and-director bar, and impose a conduct-based injunction against future violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17a-14 thereunder. The Court will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the Commission upon motion of the Court.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Eric R. Werner. The investigation was supervised by Amy C. Welshhans and Glenn S. Gordon of the SEC's Office of Inspector General.\u00c2\u00a0 The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U."
