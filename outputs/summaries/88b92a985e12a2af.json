  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment against the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission against Avista Corp., a publicly-traded utility company, for failing to comply with a court order requiring it to pay an annualized rate of return of 9.9 percent.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., on January 11, 2016, Avista filed a request with the WUTC for a rate increase based on an attrition study that determined that Avista had earned less than its authorized rate base from 2008 until 2013.  The complaint alleges that the attrition study was flawed and failed to support the agency\u2019s recommendation.  In its final judgment, the court held that the agency exceeded its statutory authority by not requiring an attrition adjustment for its electric and natural gas operations.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the agency consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders Avista to pay a $14.5 million attrition adjustment in the amount of $6.7 million, a $6 million penalty, and a $12 million civil penalty.   The court also granted Avista a temporary restraining order, freezing the company's assets, and ordering an accounting of the losses incurred in connection with the attrition adjustment. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by James J. Hoecker and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency in this matter."
