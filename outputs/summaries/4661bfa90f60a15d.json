The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, alleges that James Franklin Atkisson, Jr., of Anderson, Kansas, engaged in a pattern of repeated oral sex and intercourse with a child under 14 years old.  According to the complaint, the alleged conduct occurred between October 31 and November 1, 2013, when Atkisson was 47 and A.A.B. told law enforcement she had vaginal intercourse with Atkisson.  At the time of the alleged incident, Atkisson had no significant prior criminal history and had no prior felony convictions.  In a judgment that permanently enjoins Atkisson from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3), and orders him to pay a penalty of 186 months imprisonment.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and ordering that he pay a $25,000 civil penalty and a $10,000 officer-and-director bar, and that he will be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, other than for his own benefit.   The court also granted Atkisson's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from associating with anyone with a history of criminal history, including his prior convictions for child molesters and for other serious crimes.  On November 2, 2018, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction against Atkisson and ordered him to comply with the court's order.  Last week, the Court of Appeals issued an order requiring the court to consider the facts of a criminal case when determining whether to impose a sentence of a life sentence.  It also ordered Atkisson to pay disgorgement of $2,965, plus prejudgment interest of $1,955, and a civil penalty of $75,000.  This order is subject to court approval.  Earlier this month, a federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, issued a final order imposing a mandatory life sentence on Atkisson based on the facts alleged in a probable cause affidavit filed by the victim's family.  As part of the order, the district court agreed to a five-year suspended conduct-based suspension and to a six-year conduct-free suspension.  A hearing on November 5, 2018 was scheduled for"
