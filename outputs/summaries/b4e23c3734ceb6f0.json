  "summary": "On March 16, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of four felony counts of pre-meditated murder and sentenced to a mandatory life sentence.  The court found that defendant Isaac Beasley violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also found that Beasley failed to raise the issue of whether he would have accepted a plea offer had he been properly advised by trial counsel that a mandatory minimum sentence was mandatory for a conviction for a kidnapping with bodily injury charge. Beasley also allegedly failed to disclose that he had been counseled by counsel that he would not have accepted the plea offer if convicted of the kidnapping charge. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against Beasley. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, charges Beasley with violating the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Beasley consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC charged Beasley for failing to raise a reasonable probability that his trial counsel would have agreed to a sentence that was less severe than the mandatory sentence that he was facing upon conviction.  Beasley agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the securities laws, ordering him to repay the amount of his penalty, and imposing a $500,000 penalty. The final judgment also ordered Beasley to pay $1.5 million in restitution, and ordered him to be barred from the securities industry for five years.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Richard M. Thompson of the Atlanta Regional Office issued an order suspending Beasley from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The order also imposed a five-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, including securities in the securities of any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, or nationally recognized statistical statistical rating organization. The Court also issued a temporary restraining order halting Beasley\u2019s"
