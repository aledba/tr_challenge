  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered final judgments against the Edmond, Utah, school district, and its principal in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah on January 20, 2016, alleges that the Edmonds school district violated the antifraud provisions of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) by unilaterally placing A.T. at Provo Canyon School, a residential facility in Provo, Utah.  According to the complaint, the district's IEPs, which are designed to identify and evaluate children with disabilities, are only two pages long and contain detailed information about how to deal with a child with a severe developmental delay.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the placement was not sufficient to meet the developmental and needs of a child who has been suspended or expelled from school.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, the school district consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the district from violating the IEP and orders it to reimburse the parents for the costs associated with the placement.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court also ordered the district to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that will be determined by the court upon motion of the district.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1414(a)(1).  The case originated from the Office of Education and Advocacy, which administers the Education Quality Assurance Act, and was supervised by the Division of Education's Office of Inspector General. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Education in this matter."
