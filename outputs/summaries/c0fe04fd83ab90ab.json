  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Connecticut man who claimed that the state of Connecticut unlawfully recorded his telephonic communications in violation of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that, on May 26, 2010, Lawrence S. Jezouit, a former state trooper, sought to record a telephone conversation that he had with an agent of the Internal Revenue Service. When the agent informed him that she would cease further discussion and would not continue so long as the call was being recorded, the plaintiff allegedly called the agent and left messages on their respective automated answering systems. The complaint alleges that these recordings were obtained illegally because the state's routine practice of recording telephone communications was in excess of its statutory authority.  According to the complaint, the complaint further alleges that he initially lobbied the state legislature to waive sovereign immunity from liability with respect to certain state officials, with the exception of Governor Malloy. When his lobbying efforts failed, he allegedly \"reluctantly\" commenced this action in his own interest and in the interest of the public. The court agreed that the defendants violated the doctrine of sovereign immunity, which requires defendants to do more than allege a substantial allegation of wrongful conduct to qualify a claim for a civil action against the state.  In its judgment, the court agreed with the SEC's findings that the defendant violated the sovereign immunity provision of Section 17a-550 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On June 18, 2015, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the United States District Court in Connecticut entered a judgment against the defendants that permanently restrains the defendants from violating these provisions. The judgment also ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 each. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Department of Public Safety, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Connecticut Office of Inspector General in this matter."
