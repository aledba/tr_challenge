  "summary": "On October 22, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a class action action brought by the victims of an automobile recall.  The court entered the final judgment against the defendants, who are alleged to have violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, the defendants raised the issue of whether a reliable method of estimating class-wide damages could be used to determine whether a car had a defective shifter. The complaint alleges that Dr. Justine Hastings, a former research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The court also granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Dr. Strombom. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Enforcement's Retail Strategy Task Force. The litigation will be led by Jennifer Chun Barry and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the Financial Conduct Authority."
