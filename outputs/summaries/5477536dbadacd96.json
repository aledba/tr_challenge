  "summary": "On April 24, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., alleges that, under the Batson framework, a defendant is entitled to a right not to be excluded from jury selection based on race or on his experience as a college student.  According to the complaint, the defendant, who is black, opted to exercise his right to a jury trial on the basis of his race and experience.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On June 25, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay civil penalties of up to $100,000, and ordering a temporary restraining order against the defendants from participating in jury selection.  A hearing on June 26, 2019 was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Eastern time.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221."
