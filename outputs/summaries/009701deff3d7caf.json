  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Charles Patrick Ellis for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that Ellis violated the federal securities laws by agreeing to a plea bargain that included a five-year prior serious felony conviction enhancement.  According to the complaint, Ellis consented to the plea bargain without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, and agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The complaint further alleges that, in a parallel action, the California Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Ellis arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that defendants entered guilty plea agreements with defendants who were not convicted of a serious felony and were sentenced to a stipulated term of 17 years four months before Senate Bill No. 1393 was passed.  Without admitting to the SEC\u2019s findings, Ellis agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged sections of the securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Ellis also agreed to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  On January 1, 2020, the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against Ellis, as well as an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receiver of the receiver.  Separately, on January 2, 2019, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued an order imposing a preliminary injunction against Ellis and ordering him to comply with the court order.  It also ordered him to sign a civil injunctive relief order, which is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01/2019.   The Commission of Inquiry has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an investor's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov website. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of investing in a penny stock.
