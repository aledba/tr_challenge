  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against Westlake Vinyls, Inc., a Kentucky-based chemical processing company, for violating the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on November 28, 2018, Westlake filed a complaint in federal court in Calvert City, Kentucky, alleging that, contrary to Westlake's written policy, Smith was terminated in retaliation for orchestrating a meeting between the employees and the defendant at which he was terminated.  The complaint further alleges that Smith failed to adequately allege that he exhausted the grievance process prior to filing his termination claim.  As alleged in the complaint, Smith's termination was preempted by the federal Labor Relations Board.  In its judgment, the court found that Smith violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, and 13b2-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in Smith's Complaint, the Court also ordered Westlake to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, which is equal to Smith's disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a $500,000 civil penalty.  Westlake has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 336 of the Exchange Act, and orders him to pay $1.5 million in civil penalties, which will be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.  On May 2, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Smith, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against him from participating in any collective bargaining activity, including strike, collectively bargaining, strike, or picketing.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Welshhans and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter in the Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office, and the Kentucky Attorney General's Office in this matter."
