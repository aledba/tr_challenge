  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against Currituck Sunshine Farm, LLC and Ecoplexus, Inc., a registered appraiser, in a case that was unsealed today.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, on 11 December 2015, CurritUCK Sunshine Farm and its co-owner, Tommy Cleveland, filed an application for a conditional use permit for a solar farm on the property formerly used as Goose Creek Golf Course. The complaint alleges that the solar farm would reduce the impervious surfaces of the property and leave plenty of land to manage and absorb surface water effectively.  The complaint further alleges that, contrary to the Board\u2019s findings, the proposed solar farm will not be harmonious with the surrounding properties and will be in violation of the use permit provisions of the federal government.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney for North Carolina announced criminal charges against the co-owners of Goose Creek, alleging that they violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 15(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.   The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint against the Board of Commissioners alleges that it improperly denied the application for the permit on the basis of insufficient evidence, and that the Board violated Rule 15a-1.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the Board has agreed to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from future violations of the anti-manipulation provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 16(a)(2) of The Securities Act, and ordering the Commission to conduct an independent examination of the matter. The Commission has also agreed to an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue an order suspending or issuing a temporary restraining order against the Commission from issuing or issuing any order suspending any such order, including the issuance of any other order requiring an SEC-approved permit.  On May 24, 2018, the Commission issued an order ordering the receiver to comply with the pre-clearance requirements of Section 5(b).  The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted"
