  "summary": "On July 23, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment ordering the Department of Homeland Security to expedite the removal of non-citizens from the United States through expedited removal.  The court's order, which was entered on July 24, 2020, permanently enjoins the agency from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the agency to provide a mechanism for expediting removal. The court also granted the agency's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and other emergency relief.  In its order, the court also issued an order temporarily suspending the expedited process.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, the Court found that, in violation of Section 1225(b)(1)(A)(i) and (ii) of that provision, and that the court had jurisdiction to determine whether or not to issue an expedited order pursuant to that provision.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the agency has agreed to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from violating these provisions, and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by David A. Cohen and supervised in the Office of Inspector General. The investigation was supervised by Marc Blau, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Attorney General's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United Nations Office of Economic and Risk Analysis."
