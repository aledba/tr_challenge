  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio yesterday entered a final judgment against Loveland School District and Symmes Township, Ohio, in a civil injunctive action brought by the school district.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Loveland, Ohio on March 11, 2016, Loveland school district and school district officials violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"STIF\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that Loveland violated the reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, and that the district was entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on those provisions.  In its complaint, the court also found that the amount of the district's alleged liability was insufficient to determine when the district would need to restructure its tax-increment debt.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, however, the district has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Loveland from future violations of these provisions, and orders Loveland to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Loveland also agreed to pay disgorgement of $400,000 and prejudgment interest of $2,500, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school district for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Ohio Office of Inspector General's Market Abuse Unit, and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gaunt. The case has been supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Retail Strategy Task Force.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the FBI, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Ohio Department of Health and Human Services."
