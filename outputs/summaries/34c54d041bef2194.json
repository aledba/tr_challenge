  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Justin Leon Walker, finding that he had waived his right to counsel by acting in a manipulative manner.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Mobile, Alabama, Walker was indicted for four felony counts of wire fraud and attempted securities fraud.  The SEC alleges that, from at least 2014 through 2016, Walker raised the issue of whether to retain a standby counsel as part of a strategy to delay and obstruct the proceedings.  In its judgment, the court found that Walker had waived the right to representation by engaging in a pattern of aggressive, dilatory, and aggressive conduct that resulted in his loss of counsel.  As alleged in the complaint, the trial court also found that appellant had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he was entitled to the assistance of counsel under Section 17(a)(1) of that Act.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Walker consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and appoints a new attorney.  Walker also agreed to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as a result of his misconduct.  On March 6, 2017, the jury trial was rescheduled for March 6.  A hearing on April 1, 2016, was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. The trial court appointed Gregory Bane (counsel #8) as standby counsel for the trial.  At the time, the complaint alleges that appellant vacillated between representing himself and wanting to be represented by a lawyer, and made it clear to the jury that he did not want to cooperate with the counsel and was not entitled to a fair opportunity to represent himself.  After a hearing on March 13, 2017 the jury deliberated for a short period of time before deciding to send a message to appellant that it was time to restock the roster of attorneys available to represent him.  Finally, on April 24, 2015, a trial court granted the motion and appointed Stephen K. Smith as counsel, despite having been warned repeatedly that such continued behavior would result in the loss of court-appointed counsel. The court also appointed another attorney, Gregory Bane, who represented himself at the time of the alleged misconduct, to represent appellant at trial. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David T. McCluskey and Eric R. Werner of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr."
