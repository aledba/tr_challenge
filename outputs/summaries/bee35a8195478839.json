  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Department of Justice (DOJ) in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that DOJ violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that, contrary to DOJ\u2019s representations, DOJ failed to adequately evaluate the impact of illegal immigration enforcement on state and local law enforcement efforts to detect and prevent illegal immigration. The SEC also alleges that the DOJ failed not to include a mandatory minimum drinking age in the application.  According to the complaint, DOJ also failed to consider whether the mandatory drinking age is relevant to the purpose of the federal grant program.  In its judgment, the court found that DOJ exceeded its statutory authority in including two scoring factors in determining the amount of federal funds it would allocate to states and localities. The court also ruled that DOJ did not violate the federal spending provision of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, DOJ agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws, orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders the DOJ to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about how to apply for a federal grant, see Litigation Release No. 10382(b)(5) (2009).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Criminal Justice Division. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.N. Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Alabama Department of Public Health and Human Services in this matter."
