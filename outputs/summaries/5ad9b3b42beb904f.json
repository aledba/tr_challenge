  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Ingredion, Inc. (\"Ingredion\") for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 8(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that, on April 6, 2015, the company and its chief negotiator, Ken Meadows, first met with employees at the plant and told them that they would never return to work if they went on strike. According to the complaint, however, the manager allegedly told the employees that he had \"a lot of things to give\" and that he \"needed to get together and negotiate\" with them. The complaint alleges that the manager also allegedly told one of the employees not to \"let a few people in the union body sway what [he] wanted to do.\"  The complaint further alleges that in July 2015, after agreeing to the employer\u2019s offer of a new collective bargaining agreement, Meadows told the employee that he would like a raise of 3 to 3.5 percent, an increased pension multiplier, different work schedules, more vacation days, and health insurance coverage for early retirees. The employee allegedly told Meadows that the employer had a lot to give, that the union was not telling them everything, and that the parties needed to get to a reasonable good-faith effort to bargain collectively.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Labor Relations today announced that it has issued an order suspending the suspension of the suspension pending an investigation by the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations. The Office of Inspector General has issued a related order, which is subject to court approval, ordering the company to comply with the Commission's order. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Postal Inspection Service, and the Federal Trade Commission in this matter."
