  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Social Security Administrator Vickie Gilbert, finding that she failed to raise her Appointments Clause challenge to the agency.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, on July 22, 2015, Gilbert, a Social Security Administration employee, filed an application for disability benefits.  The complaint alleges that, despite having raised her claim weeks after Lucia's announcement, the agency did not deem it reasonable to raise the issue before the court.  As alleged in the complaint, Gilbert was not required to do so because the agency's internal policy requires that a claimant exhaust all relevant issues before it is appointed, including those in requests for review.  In a parallel action, on September 5, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency motion to dismiss Gilbert's application for Social Security, which was subsequently denied by the SEC.   The SEC's Complaint alleges that on or about July 21, 2015 the SEC appointed Vivian A. Berryhill, a social security officer for the SEC, as an Assistant Commissioner of Social Security.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, Berryhill consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against her from appearing before the SEC as an officer or director of a public agency for a period of disability and disability insurance benefits. The SEC also seeks a permanent injunction against future violations, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against Gilbert. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau."
