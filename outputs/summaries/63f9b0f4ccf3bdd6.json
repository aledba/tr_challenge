  "summary": "The Arizona Corporation Commission today announced that it has agreed to settle charges that it acted arbitrarily and capriciously in imposing a consolidated rate on Sun City, Arizona residents in violation of the Arizona Constitution.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arizona, alleges that the Commission violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by imposing a price-based rate on the Sun City customers.  According to the complaint, the Commission's decision to impose the consolidated rate was based on a number of factors, including the fact that most of Sun City's wastewater pipes were nearing the end of their useful life and required approximately $57.4 million in improvements over the next ten years.  In addition, the complaint alleges the Commission failed to adequately consider the merits of the Commission\u2019s finding that Sun City residents had fewer resources and lower income than residents of other Sun City districts.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, SCHOA has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the Commission from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders the Commission to conduct a fair and reasonable review of the proposed rate.  SCHOA also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that will be determined by the court at a later date.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Arizona Department of Commerce v. Arizona Public Service, Inc., 206 Ariz. 531, 533-34, 578 P.2d 612, 614-15 (1956).  The Commission also agreed not to impose a rate based upon the \"fair and reasonable\" nature of its proposed consolidation, which would require all of the customers within the consolidated district to receive the same rate as they would receive under the stand-alone scenario. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission has also not agreed to a permanent injunction prohibiting it from imposing a rate that is inconsistent with the facts presented in its opinion.  Additionally, the SEC has not yet issued an order requiring it to consider whether it has sufficient evidence to determine whether a rate should be imposed based upon those facts, and has not provided any evidence to support its finding that the proposed consolidated rate is unreasonable."
