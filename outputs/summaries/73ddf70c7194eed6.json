  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Bausch & Lomb, Inc., a medical device manufacturer, and two other companies for violating the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on May 9, 2017, B &L filed a complaint in federal district court in Manhattan alleging that B&L violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint also alleges that, in violation of Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 5b2-3 thereunder, B&l failed to adequately disclose to the federal agency that it had a duty of reasonable care to protect the safety and security of medical devices.  In addition, the complaint alleges that B &l violated federal law by failing to adequately inform the federal government of the risks associated with the medical devices it manufactures.  As alleged in the complaint, the federal law requires that a defendant make a reasonable determination of whether there is a reasonable basis for a reasonable response to a state law claim.  For example, the SEC alleges that the defendants failed to do so in light of the fact that the complaint was filed in federal court in New York, and that the SEC failed to inform the parties of this fact-based determination.  Finally, the court found that, based upon the SEC&rsquo;s finding in the case, that the Defendants violated the federal reporting requirements for medical devices, they are liable under Section 5 for violations of Exchange Act Rule 5a-14.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of federal law, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requiring them to submit a civil injunctive action against each of the Defendants.  B&LL has also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.00, which is a penalty equal to the amount of disgorging that defendant will pay.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the United States District Court in Manhattan entered final judgments against the Defendants in a related administrative proceeding against Sansone, Sansone and Sansone.  Sansone agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Exchange Act Section 5, bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer and sale of any medical device, and bars Sansone from serving as an officer or director of a public company.\u00c2\u00a0 Sansone also agreed"
