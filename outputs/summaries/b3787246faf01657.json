  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Lynnara Wilson for failing to raise her claim for administrative law relief.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Wilson was improperly appointed as an administrative law judge because she was unable to raise a constitutional claim.  According to the complaint, Wilson raised her claim at the earliest possible opportunity in the administrative proceedings following Lucia's decision to appoint her as an independent judge.  As alleged, the SEC's Complaint alleges that the presiding administrative judge did not have the authority to determine the merits of Wilson's claims, and that Wilson failed to raise the issue at the appropriate time.  In addition, the Complaint further alleges that, as a result of Lucia's appointment, Wilson was not entitled to a hearing before a different, constitutionally appointed judge, and therefore could not raise her claims before the SEC.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaints, Wilson consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and requires Wilson to pay disgorgement of $1,500, which is equal to the amount of her civil penalty.  Wilson also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years, and to a five-year officer-director bar.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5:18-cv-00302, July 16, 2019.   The Complaint charges Wilson with violating Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an order requiring Wilson to comply with the Commission's requests for an asset freeze.  It also seeks a temporary restraining order, an order appointing a receiver, and a bar against Wilson from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including Social Security and Medicare, as well as a civil injunctive proceeding against Wilson.  To learn more about the Administrative Procedure Act and the Administrative Procedures Act, see Rules 10b2-1, Rules 12b-20, 13a-13, 13b-11, 13d-13 thereunder. \u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the Department of Justice today announced that it has obtained a court order requiring it to consider Wilson's civil injunctions, ordering a hearing on her behalf, and ordering the SEC to conduct a de novo review of her claims.
