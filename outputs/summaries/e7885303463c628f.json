  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the CFPB, finding that the agency's director is entitled to an acting director and to the appointment of an acting Director.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, under the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was entitled to the right to serve as an independent director in the event of an emergency.  According to the complaint, the Deputy Director provision, which is required by the federal securities laws, requires that an officer or employee serve as acting Director in the absence or absence of a director.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Office of Compliance (OCC) have agreed to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgment also enjoins OCC from acting as an unregistered broker-dealer and orders OCC to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order appointing a temporary acting director to replace the director of the OCC.  OCC and OCC have also issued orders appointing temporary restraining orders against the acting director. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and orders the issuance of an order imposing a temporary restraining order.  On November 24, 2017, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court in Manhattan, alleging that President Donald Trump improperly appointed a Deputy Director in violation of Section 5 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, and that OCC acted as an \"unprecedented\" regulator of the agency. The complaint also alleges that the CFO's Deputy Director was improperly appointed to the position of acting Director by the President without the President's knowledge or consent.   The complaint further alleges that OTC acted as a \"pre-judgment\" to determine whether the duty of the acting Director should be followed by an independent board of directors. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. McCole and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Timothy J. Donahue and Glenn S. Gordon. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson."
