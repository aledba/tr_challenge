  "summary": "On April 12, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a temporary restraining order against Antonio Pinto, a New York City resident with mobility disabilities, from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Pinto misrepresented to the SEC that he and his surveying team had to measure various building features on whose ADA compliance he purported to provide exact measurements, instead employing what he called an \"eye test\" to determine whether those features complied with ADA accessibility standards.  According to the complaint, however, Pinto failed to consider the feasibility of remediation and instead relied on his own research, which he deemed insufficient to support the SEC's findings.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in addition to failing to consider Pinto's research, the SEC alleges that he failed to adequately assess whether the architectural features of Defendants' stationhouses comply with the relevant ADA standards, and failed to include his own opinion in his compliance reports.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Rule 702 and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Pinto also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  Separately, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction against Pinto from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in violation of the federal securities laws, and ordered him to pay an $8,500 civil penalty to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion by the SEC.  On May 24, 2019 the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Brooklyn, New York, charging Pinto with violating Rule 702, and seeking a permanent injunction against future violations.  To learn more about ADA compliance, see ADA.gov.   In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges on May 17, 2019. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov\u00c2\u00a0check.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
