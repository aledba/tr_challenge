  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, Louisiana, alleges that, from at least 2011 through 2014, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. (\"Entergy\"), a subsidiary of NRG Energy, Inc., engaged in a horizontal price-fixing conspiracy.  According to the complaint, this alleged conspiracy involved multiple power companies, including Entergy and Entergy, which were the exclusive marketing agents for the three horizontal power companies at the time they allegedly refused to deal with JRC.  In addition, the complaint alleges that HRI and NRG/LaGen entered into exclusive marketing agreements with each of the power companies for the purpose of raising prices of C-618 fly ash and other products produced by those companies.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, order them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits, and impose a penny stock bar against each of them.  JRC also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and from participating in any offering of securities in the future.  On December 4, 2019, the court granted JRC's motion for partial summary judgment and granted it the right to apply for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the charged sections of the securities laws.  As set forth in the order, JRC is entitled to a permanent injunction, to disgorge its ill-gotten gains, to pay civil penalties, and to the appointment of a receiver to determine whether to issue an injunction against future violations.   The court's order also prohibits JRC from acting as an unregistered broker-dealer or as an agent of a publicly traded company. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Louisiana, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in this matter."
