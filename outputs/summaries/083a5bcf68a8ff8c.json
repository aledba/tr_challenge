  "summary": "On October 28, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against Edward Jones & Co., L.P., a limited partnership and registered broker/dealer based in Westfield, Indiana.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. Louis, alleges that, beginning in July 1998, Edward Jones hired John Hermelbracht, a former financial advisor at Edward Jones, as its financial advisor. According to the complaint, after learning that Mr. Kerr was leaving Edward Jones in August 2019, he began soliciting his clients to transfer their assets to Thurston. The complaint alleges that in the days following his departure from Edward Jones and the commencement of his employment with Thurston, he allegedly made several phone calls to his clients, including one to a friend who sought out his services after learning of his departure. The SEC also alleges that shortly after receiving his notification, he sent an informational packet to Edward Jones clients informing them that he had left Edward Jones.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, these were client reports, which contained false and misleading statements about the status of client accounts.  In addition, the Complaint alleges that the defendants' contemporaneous notification to clients about his departure did not corroborate the allegations of the complaint.  Edward Jones' Complaint charges Mr. HermelBracht and Kennetta White with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments that permanently restrains and enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar. The settlements are subject to court approval.   The litigation will be led by Mr. Baker and Ms. White and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Missouri Secretary of State's Office, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Missouri Attorney General's Office in this matter."
