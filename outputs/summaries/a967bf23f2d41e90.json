  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who claimed that he was falsely convicted of a felony and was not entitled to the services of a public defender.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, on May 25, 2014, a motorist driving behind the defendant observed that his car remained stopped through two cycles of a stoplight. The complaint alleges that the defendant, who was not in custody at the time of the alleged crime, was unable to post bonds and had retained a private attorney to represent him during the trial.  According to the complaint, the defendant then requested that the court order his shackles to be removed, which the court did not do.

The judgment also prohibits the defendants from participating in any offering of a penny stock or offering of any penny stock, and prohibits the defendant from associating with any broker dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, penny stock dealer, or nationally recognized statistical statistical rating organization. The SEC also prohibits defendants from impersonating or posing as a registered representative in the presence of a judge or jury.  For example, the SEC requires defendants to show cause and effect when appearing before a jury in person before a judge, including by providing an explanation of why they should not be shackled, and requires that defendants show cause, when they should be restrained, to demonstrate that they are not liable for the imposition of a civil penalty.
