  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Timothy L. Becker, a Scotts Bluff County, N.C., resident who was convicted in a federal court for violating a protection order. The court found that Becker violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered that Becker be sentenced to imprisonment for 180 days and ordered to be served consecutively to one another. According to the court's order, Becker was not present at the sentencing hearing when the court imposed the mandatory minimum of 10 years of imprisonment for each of his 21 prior felony convictions. Instead, the court ordered Becker to serve a total of 180 days in county jail. Becker pled no contest to all 21 of his convictions and was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment for a Class I felony.  The court also found no misconduct in sentencing Becker.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Becker. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges Becker with violating Section 28-106 of the federal securities laws, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The complaint also seeks a preliminary injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and an officer and director bar against Becker from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the SEC's orders.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Becker consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and bars him from serving any amount of time in the district court. The settlement is subject to court approval. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Scott A. Kasper and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The investigation was supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The matter of the sentencing was handled by Jennifer A. Barry and John R. Rymas of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Arizona Department of Corrections, the Nebraska Department of Criminal Justice, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
