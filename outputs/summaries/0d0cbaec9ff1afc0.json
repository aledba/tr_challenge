  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Colorado today entered a final judgment against Colorado Citizens Protecting our Constitution, LLC, a Colorado-based political committee, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court found that Colorado Citizens was not a political committee because it did not have the major purpose of nominating or electing candidates.  According to the court's order, however, Colorado Citizens paid for a radio advertisement that supported the candidacy of Bob Gardner for state senate in 2015.  As alleged in the complaint, the judge did not consider Colorado Citizens' major purpose when he decided to base his major purpose analysis on the company's independent spending in the consecutive twelve-month period spanning 2015 and 2016.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Campaign Integrity, which was filed in federal court in Colorado Springs, Colorado, today announced that it has obtained a temporary restraining order and an order appointing an administrative law judge to preside over the case.  In a parallel action, the Colorado Secretary of State's Office today filed a civil injunctive action, charging Colorado Citizens with violating the federal securities laws and ordering the issuance of a cease-and-desist order and ordering an asset freeze and other emergency relief.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott Frost, John Rymas, and Eric Werner of the Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Graham Loomis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Office of Administrative Law, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Colorado Department of Finance."
