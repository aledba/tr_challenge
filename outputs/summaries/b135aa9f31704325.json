  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas today entered a final judgment against a Texas-based insurance company and its former owner in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that La Joya Independent School District (La Joya ISD) and Bob Trevino Insurance Workplace Benefits Advisor (Trevino) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 271.153 of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, from September 9, 2015 to August 31, 2018, La JoyA ISD and TrevINO signed a contract that provided for the provision of health care benefits to its employees. The agreement provided for a five-year exemption from liability for breach of contract claims. The settlement, which was subject to court approval, provided that the settlement would be subject to the court's approval.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the settlement is subject to approval by the court.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Treviino. The SEC also announced that it would conduct a parallel criminal investigation.  Among other things, the SEC is seeking a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and a civil penalty.  On May 2, 2019, a federal district court in San Antonio entered a judgment ordering the SEC to pay civil penalties of $1.5 million, $1 million in disgorgement, and $100,000 in prejudgment interest. The court also issued an order requiring the district attorney to show cause of action in the case before it could issue a judgment imposing civil penalties.  To determine whether to proceed with the litigation, the court will consider the merits of the case and determine the appropriate remedies.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-16-00473-CV, 2018 WL 1101656.  An SEC order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver will be issued a copy of the judgment on May 22, 2019.  A hearing on May 24, 2019 is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  This matter is being handled by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Fort Worth Regional Office, and John R. Rymas, Regional Director of the Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA). The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
