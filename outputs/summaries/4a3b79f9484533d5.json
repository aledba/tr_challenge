  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Jeffrey Robert Petri, a convicted felon, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Ohio, Petri was sentenced to four years in prison with 577 days of pre-sentencing custody credits for time spent in custody in Ohio.  The complaint alleges that, based on the court's finding that Petri had no ability to pay the restitution fine, court operations assessment, and court facilities assessment, he was entitled to a one-year enhancement under Section 1202.4, subd. (a)(1) and a four-year additional prison term enhancement under section 1203.4.  Petri also was ordered to pay a restitution fine of $300 (&nbsp;); a court operations assess of $40 (&rdquo;); and a court facilities inspection of $30.  In addition, the court ordered Petri to pay an $80,000 civil penalty and a $30,000 court facilities examination.  Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsqua;s allegations, Petrie consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal and state securities laws, and orders him to pay $9,019.19 in restitution, $9.019.20 in pre-judgment interest, and a civil penalty of $150,000.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On November 22, 2019, the U. S. District Judge in the Northern District of California entered a judgment ordering Petrie to pay disgorgement of $1,078, which he did, plus prejudgment interest of $2,038, which was deemed satisfied by the court order.  At the same time, the Court issued a temporary restraining order against Petrie from violating the federal securities laws and ordered him to comply with the order of the court.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Attorney General's Office, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0report."
