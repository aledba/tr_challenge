  "summary": "On June 21, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Ronald Brown, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for two counts of first-degree kidnapping and one count of second-degree assault.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, Brown was charged in 2012 with a series of felony charges.  The complaint alleges that Brown was falsely told that he had a reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness when, in fact, he had never been convicted of a felony.  Brown also alleged that the defendant had a high offender score, and that the trial court had discretion to impose an exceptional sentence based on the defendant's low offender score.  In fact, according to the complaint, Brown had a lower offender score than he had on the original sentencing.  As a result of the defendant\u2019s actions, the court ultimately imposed an exceptional prison sentence of 638 months, which Brown was left with.   The SEC alleges that, in a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Brown, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Additionally, Brown agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver and ordering the receiver to respond to the receiver at a later date. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Birkenheier and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Alabama Department of Criminal Justice."
