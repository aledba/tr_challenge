  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Michael Lazarin, a California resident charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that Lazarin violated Section 3344.1 of the federal securities laws by using the name and likeness of Audrie Taylor Pott, a San Jose, California resident who committed suicide in 2012.  According to the complaint, the Potts' claims arose from the fact that they had been \"approached by various movie producers, Hollywood film crews, publishers, and the like\" seeking \"commercial exploitation\" of the celebrity's name or likeness in the Netflix movie Audrie & Daisy, which he described as \"a commercial endeavor.\"  The complaint alleges that, in reality, Lazarin had not engaged in any professional fund-raising or for purposes of advertising services provided by him and others\" without their consent.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's order, Lazar has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Lazarin arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On November 23, 2016, a federal district court in San Diego entered a temporary restraining order and ordered Lazarin to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, a civil monetary penalty, and an officer-and-director bar from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney.  As part of the settlement, the SEC agreed to a permanent injunction and to a conduct-based injunction.  It also agreed to pay a $25,000 civil penalty and a $10,000 officer-director bars.   The settlement is subject to court approval."
