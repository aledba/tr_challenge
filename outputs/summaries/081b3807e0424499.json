  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment against Preston L. Marshall, Jr., a former trustee of the Harrier Trust, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, alleges that, from at least May 5, 2006 through May 12, 2017, Preston and two co-trustees, Edward Alexander and Adam P. Johnson, were improperly appointed as trustee by Mrs. Marshall.  According to the complaint, the trustees were not qualified to be trustees and instead appointed individuals who had no appreciable financial background or expertise in the management of portfolios.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the trustees had ulterior motives, rendering them unable to act as a prudent administrator on behalf of the trust and its beneficiaries.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Preston has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and orders a civil penalty of $100,000.  Preston has also agreed to be barred from serving as a trustee by the SEC as a result of his misconduct.  On January 4, 2018, the trial court granted Preston's motion for summary judgment and ordered him to comply with the court's order, which requires him to provide a copy of the judgment to the court for approval of the final judgment, which is subject to court approval.  After the court granted summary judgment, Preston agreed to pay a $50,000 civil penalty and to be permanently barred from the trustee's office for five years.   The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1771. \u00c2\u00a0On January 13, 2019, the SEC filed an amended complaint against Preston, alleging that, in violation of the Trust Code, he was improperly appointed trustee by his wife, Elaine T. Marshall (referred to as \"Mrs. Marshall\").  The complaint also alleges that Preston violated the fiduciary duties of the trustee by failing to provide sufficient evidence to justify his appointment as trustee, and that he was not entitled to the appointment of a successor trustee under the trust code.  Finally, on January 9, 2018 the SEC issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the transfer of assets from the Trust to the receiver of the assets entrusted to the trustee."
