  "summary": "The Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center-El Paso today announced that it has agreed to settle a civil injunctive action brought by the university against Loretta K. Flores.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, alleges that Flores violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, Flores was terminated on July 1, 2014, shortly after she was hired as an executive associate at Texas Tech.  In its complaint, Texas Tech alleges that Dr. Jose Manuel De La Rosa, then the university's provost, made the decision to reclassify Flores, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  De LaRosa also agreed to pay Flores a $1,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting to the SEC's allegations, Flores consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a $2,500 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar.\u00c2\u00a0 The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Texas Tech v. Delfino, et al., 2017, No. 17-cv-10221, (Dec. 22, 2017).  The case is being handled by John Rymas, Chief of the Texas Department of Health and Human Services, and Kelly L. Gibson, Regional Director of the University of Texas at El Paso. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter.&nbsp; The SEC encourages investors to check the background of anyone offering them an investment in a business by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  Investors can also check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify if they are professionals."
