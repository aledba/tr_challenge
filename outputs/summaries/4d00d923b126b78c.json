  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Eliberto Cruz Jacobo, a convicted human trafficking ringleader who was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison for soliciting and acting as an unregistered sex offender.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, Jacobo used the fictional persona of Marlissa to solicit and engage in sexual activity with seven minors under the age of 18. The complaint alleges that Jacobo solicited the solicitation of the minors by posing as a woman holding money and then engaging in oral copulation and vaginal intercourse with one of the victims. Jacobo also allegedly solicited and acted as a \"pander\" to the victims, telling the victim that she could make $150 \"tak[ing] care of a guy in bed.\" The complaint further alleges that, in reality, the victims were not prostitutes, and Jacobo did not engage in the soliciting or acting as a prostitute. Instead, the complaint alleges, he engaged in a series of \"pandering\" activities that included soliciting the purchase and sale of a thong bikini and engaging in a \"sex act\" with the victim.  Jacobo was convicted on all of those counts and sentenced to a total of 15 years in prison.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Kelly L. Gibson, Eric R. Birkenheier, and Patrick J. McCluskey of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the California Department of Justice, and the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1755. The Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of pandering, including the potential for victims to be targeted by the perpetrators of the pandering.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Jacobo.  On May 24, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against him, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aiding and abetting Jacobo's violations"
