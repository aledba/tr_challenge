  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a New Jersey-based company that has agreed to pay $300,000 in child and spousal support to an ex-wife.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Jersey, Surender Malhan filed a civil injunctive action in 2011 alleging that New Jersey officials violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that Malhan sought a reduction in his child support obligations after receiving favorable court judgments in 2011 and 2012. Malhan's wife, Alina Myronova, filed a second amended complaint in 2013, alleging that the district court had jurisdiction over Malhan\u2019s federal claims.  The SEC alleges that the District Court found Malhan liable for violations of Section 1257 of the Exchange Act, and ordered Malhan to pay a civil penalty of $6,000 per month.  Malhan also had to give his wife rental income from their jointly owned properties, which the court ordered her to return because she had been living with her boyfriend.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Malhan consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $3,000, which is equal to the amount Malhan has already paid in child support.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Malhan.  On May 30, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action in federal court against New Jersey Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, charging Malhan with violating Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(A) and Rule 15a-1 thereunder, and seeking a permanent injunction against future violations. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John F. Manning, Daniel J. Meltzer, and David L. Shapiro of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Manning and Mr. Shapiro. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Office of Inspector General, the U.N. Secret Service, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
