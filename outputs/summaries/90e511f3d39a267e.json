  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a former officer of the Chicago Police Department and three other officers in a related administrative proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, since 1963, the Policemen's Annuity and Benefit Fund of the City of Chicago has been used to benefit Chicago police officers, their widows or widowers, and their children.  According to the complaint, the fund's calculation of pension benefits was based on salary information compiled and maintained by the Chicago Fire Department, and the duty availability allowance was not included in the calculation of the officers' benefits.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the fund failed to timely initiate administrative review of its calculation of duty availability pay, which is required by the pension code to determine whether a person has been entitled to a pension benefit when he or she is not entitled to one.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Separately, the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment in a separate administrative proceeding, and ordered the payment of civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Federal Bureau of Investigation entered a judgment against the defendants that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay civil penalties of $100,000 each, and orders the defendants to pay a $75,000 civil penalty. The order also prohibits the defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply for pension funds after five years of service. The court also issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and appointing a receiver to oversee the investigation. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Secretary of State's Office, the Illinois Department of Insurance, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Chicago Department of Education, the State Corporation Commission, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the United States Postal Inspection Service, the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Insurance Regulatory Surveillance Authority (FINRA)."
