  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against defendant Edward R. Cetwinski in a civil injunctive action brought by the Illinois Attorney General's Office against him.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, from at least 2009 through 2010, defendant was convicted of two felony counts of sexual assault and one count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse.  According to the complaint, the defendant was a high school graduate and was currently enrolled in college when he met the victim on a social networking website. The complaint alleges that the defendant told the victim that he was going to be a \"fake good\" and that he would \"follow me around a lot.\"  The complaint further alleges that defendant's testimony was inconsistent with the evidence presented to the court, and the court ultimately found that he had no reasonable basis to believe that the jury had reached a fair and just verdict.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against defendant, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  On December 2, 2015, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against defendant and ordered him to be enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, as well as an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his sentence. The court also granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 15(b)(2) and (3) of Exchange Act Section 10b2(a) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and (c) thereunder and orders the court to issue an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver's communications with the receiver. The order also orders the receiver to provide a copy of the complaint to the receiver, which is subject to court approval. The receiver is to be notified by phone when the receiver is ready to respond. The judge will determine the severity of the penalty upon motion of the court.  Finally, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the Illinois Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services in this matter."
