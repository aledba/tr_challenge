  "summary": "On February 26, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana entered a final judgment against Chad E. Adams, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to a four-year aggregate sentence for a felony carrying a handgun with a prior felony.  According to the SEC's complaint, Adams was living in an apartment with his girlfriend, Melissa Lagoy, when Adams was arrested and charged with a Level 5 felony with carrying a gun. Adams knew that he was not allowed to possess a gun because he did not have a valid driver's license. Adams also knew that his 2006 felony conviction for possession of marijuana prevented him from legally possessing a firearm. Adams' pre-sentence investigation report credits him with one actual jail day from June 17, 2017 through January 31, 2015. The court refused to recognize one day of actual jail time because Adams had not been in jail for several months prior to the date of the alleged felony. Adams was subsequently sentenced to four years with one year of supervised probation. Adams has agreed to the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000. The final judgment orders Adams to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws. Adams will also be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Day and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Mr. Day. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Indiana Department of Correction, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Indiana Office of Inspector General."
