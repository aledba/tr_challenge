  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Nicholas Wukoson, a Florida man who pleaded guilty in 2017 to six counts of possession of child pornography involving a prepubescent minor and 1 count of witness tampering.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, the defendant told his 13-year-old son, J.W., that he was responsible for downloading child pornography from a computer using a torrent program to upload files to other users.  The complaint further alleges that the defendant also told his son that he would take responsibility for the child pornography because he would get a \"slap on the wrist\" if the court decided to impose a 4-year sentence.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced today that it filed a parallel criminal action against the defendant, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the mandatory minimum sentence of 4 years of imprisonment for each of the seven counts.  On May 2, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Northern District of Florida entered a Final Judgment against Wukozon, ordering him to pay a penalty of no more than 4 years.  Wukzon consented to the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, and agreed to a permanent injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Securities Act of 1933, and to a five-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of a penny stock or offering of any penny stock at any time.  Additionally, the court entered a temporary restraining order halting the sale and issuance of the penny stock and ordering the purchase of a new penny stock.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Market Abuse Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Police Department, the Florida Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, the FBI, and other emergency relief agencies."
