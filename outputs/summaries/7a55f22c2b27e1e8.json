  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a former Carbondale Police Department officer who was charged with obstructing justice in connection with an unrelated criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, on March 6, 2015, Officer Blake Harsy conducted a foot patrol at Quality Inn when he observed a man entering the room through the bathroom door.  According to the complaint, the officer asked the defendant if he had any warrants for his arrest, and the defendant replied that he did not have any.  As the complaint alleges, however, when the officer confronted the defendant about the warrant, the defendant allegedly replied, \"No, ma'am, I had my wallet.\"  The complaint further alleges that the defendant then entered the room and, when confronted by the officer, gave the false name of Jakuta King Williams, who was later identified as Shanique Lincoln.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Draper consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court at a later date.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Hirsch.  On March 8, 2016, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Draper, charging him with obstruction of justice in violation of Section 31-4 of the Criminal Code of 2012, and with aiding and abetting Draper's violations of Section 17(a) and (c) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and Section\u00c2\u00a010(b)(5) and Rule\u00c2\u00a011(b).  The court also issued an order suspending Hirsch from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering him to surrender his passport.  Hirsch has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to a conduct-based injunction, which prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future.  He has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to be prohibited from associating with any person who is not a registered representative of the public company.  A hearing is scheduled for May 5, 2016.   The case is being handled by David G. Sansone, Eric R. Werner, and Shanique L."
