  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi yesterday entered a final judgment against the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in a civil action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of New York.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, in 2014, the IRS charged a Mississippi-based company with overpaying its payroll taxes. The complaint alleges that Laird Electric Company, Inc., a Mississippi corporation, had not made several quarterly payments spanning from 2006 to 2010, leaving it in arrears. According to the complaint, Laird allegedly sent three checks to the IRS as partial payments for the company\u2019s payroll taxes, including three payments of $20,000, $25,000 and $1,500 respectively, for a total of $46,500. The SEC alleges that the overpayment arose from the three checks totaling $45,500, which were accompanied by instructions specifically stating that they were to be applied only to the trust fund portion of the company's taxes for the second and third quarters of 2006 and for the third quarter of 2006. In addition, as alleged in the SEC complaint, the company had not paid its payroll tax obligations for the period ending June 30, 2006, and for which it owed a tax penalty of $145,337.51, which is equal to the amount of unpaid payroll taxes that the company still owes the government. In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced criminal charges against Laird.  In a related matter, the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of overpayments, including the dangers posed by overpayment of payroll taxes on behalf of a public company.
