  "summary": "On May 1, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against Charleston Police Officer Steven C. Englum, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charleston, alleges that, on December 7, 2008, while on duty as a full-time law enforcement officer for the City of Charleston, an officer who was injured in the line of duty while performing an emergency response to a possible criminal act called the Shop with a Cop program.  According to the complaint, Englbum was on duty at 12:30 p.m. when the call to CECOM came through.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, the officer had suffered a catastrophic injury while performing his emergency response, and he was entitled to health insurance benefits under the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the Illinois Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has issued an order suspending the suspension of the officer from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an impartial arbiter in a case involving a potential criminal act.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Engblbum consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act and orders him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $10,000, $20,000 in disgorgement, and $1,500 in prejudgment interest, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years.   The court's order also prohibits Englblbum from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product or service, and prohibits him from associating with any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Chicago Police Department, and the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
