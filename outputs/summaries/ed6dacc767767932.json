  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against Andrew Johnson, a Pennsylvania resident who voluntarily admitted himself to a treatment facility for his addiction to opiates and benzodiazepines.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Andrew and his mother, Melissa Dean and Clifton Edward Johnson, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  According to the court's order, filed on November 21, 2012, Andrew was admitted to Brandywine Addiction Treatment Center for treatment for bipolar disorder and ADHD. The court found Andrew was not currently receiving treatment for mental illness when he was admitted, and he was not under the care of a psychiatrist at the time he was receiving treatment. The Court also ruled that Andrew had a history of substance abuse and ADHD and had never been prescribed any medication to treat any mental illness.  Without admitting or denying the Court's findings, Andrew consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The judgment also prohibits Andrew from participating in treatment decisions that are unrelated to his mental illness, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a mental health treatment facility.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Western District of New York today announced criminal charges against Andrew. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, charges Andrew with violating Section 114 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers\") and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, disgorgements plus prejudgment interest, and a penny stock bar.  On November 24, 2012 Andrew was found unresponsive in his room, face down, without a pulse. The complaint also charges Andrew's mother with aiding and abetting Andrew's entry of the judgment, and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of the securities laws.  An SEC examination that led to the SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer Plumb. The litigation will be led by Andrew and Melissa Dean. The case is being supervised by Amy C. Barry. The Commission on Addiction and Mental Health has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone offering or offering them an investment in a treatment.\u00c2\u00a0The Commission's Office of Inspector General has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint to the Commission\u00c2\u00a0On"
