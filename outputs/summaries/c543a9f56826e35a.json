  "summary": "On January 9, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Shawn Willis Cook, Jr., a Colorado resident, in a civil injunctive action brought by Jamie Lee Dowling and her son, Landyn Scott Dowling.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Denver on March 3, 2015, Mr. Cook, who is Landyn's biological father, alleges that he obtained substantial relief in the amount of $42,866.60 from Dowling's and his son's wrongful death claims based on poor faith conduct in litigation.  The complaint further alleges that, although he sought a 50% apportionment of the settlement proceeds, he was ultimately allocated only 35% of the gross settlement proceeds.  As alleged in the complaint, this is substantially groundless and vexatious, because at least 30 factual allegations contained in the Dowling Declaration were false, misleading, exaggerated, unsupported by any admissible evidence, or substantially or overwhelmingly refuted by evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the Court did not consider the merits of the motion to Allocate, which was filed in part and denied in part by the SEC.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the court has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amounts of the defendants' fees.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Hach and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Denver Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Colorado Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
