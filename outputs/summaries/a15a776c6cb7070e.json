  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment in favor of a Virginia-based company that has agreed to pay $229,100 in civil penalties to settle claims that it has overstated the value of veterans' property.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, N.J., alleges that the New Jersey Department of Taxation (DOT) improperly granted a $500 exemption to veterans who served during the 1986 Libyan civil war.  According to the complaint, the exemption was granted based on the fact that the subject matter of the Libyan conflict was not specified by the federal government.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as a result of the DOJ&rsquo;s investigation, the Department of Treasury improperly granted and paid $250 as a veteran's property tax exemption from 1997 to 2017.  As a result, the department of taxation has not provided any basis for the exemption to be granted to veterans.  For example, as alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the federal tax authorities did not consider Libya as a \"time of war\" when determining whether to include it in the Definitional Statute.  Rather, the court found that the exemption violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, the company consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering the company to pay a $250 civil penalty, and imposing an $80,000 civil penalty against the company.  On May 12, 2018, the District of Columbia Court granted the company's request for a temporary restraining order against further violations of the pre-clearance provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder, and ordering the payment of a civil penalty of $228,100, which is equal to the amount of any VA benefit that the company would pay in the event of a war or emergency.  Additionally, the Court issued an order suspending the company from issuing or selling any security-related documents, including those relating to veterans' pension plans, for a period of two or more years, until it determined whether the company had sufficient evidence to issue a valid exemption under the federal laws.   The court also ordered the company not to violate the preclearance provision of Section 206, and to pay an $8,500 civil penalty. "
