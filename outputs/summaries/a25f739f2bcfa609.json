  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against K.M. Grossman, who was previously convicted of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, Grossman provided evidence to support his motion for suppression.  The complaint alleges that, on October 19, 2015, the Sauk Village Police Department received an anonymous call from an individual who reported seeing people entering a home with items, including a television and a radio. The complaint further alleges that the officers entered the home and found the television and radio in the garage and the garage. The officers then conducted a search of the area surrounding the home, including the garbage cans located on the driveway and the detached garage where the TV and radio were located. The SEC alleges that Grossman and Howard followed the officer's instructions to search the area immediately surrounding the residence and located the television, radio, and radio. As alleged in the complaint, the officers did not see anyone enter or leave the home until they arrested the individual.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Grossman for his role in the alleged scheme.  On March 5, 2017, the U. S. District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois entered a temporary restraining order and ordered Grossman to comply with the court's order. The court granted Grossman's request for a preliminary injunction and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $25,000.  Grossman consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933. The order also prohibits Grossman from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any such order. In addition, the court granted the request for an injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court order, the defendants agreed to a judgment that permanently restrains the defendants from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $5,000 and $10,000, respectively. The settlement is subject to court approval. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, David A. Kasper, and Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
