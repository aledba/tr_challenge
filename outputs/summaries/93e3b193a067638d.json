  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendants Mercuria Energy Group Limited, Mercuria Capital Partners Ltd. and Mercuria EAM, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that Mercuria and the Mercuria Parties violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of their respective securities laws by denying Miller the right to redeem his preferred shares of ULA.  According to the complaint, the defendants also violated Section 15(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1, and by failing to comply with Section 16(a)(1) of that Exchange Act.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants violated Rule 16a-1 and 17a-3 of the Exchange Act and Rule 16b-4 thereunder, and that, in violation of Section 15b-2, the broker-dealer registration provisions of the exchange agreement, Miller was not entitled to redemption of his preferred stock.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Miller consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions and orders him to pay disgorgement of $32,600,000 plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $10,000.  Miller also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a publicly-traded company for five years, and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-2024, July 24, 2013. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
