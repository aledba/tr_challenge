  "summary": "On January 16, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against the City of Harrisburg, Pa., and its three elected officials for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the City Defendants, Eric Papenfuse, Chief of the Harrisburg Police Department, Kim Stolfer, Joshua First, and Howard Bullock, raised the affirmative defense of official immunity by filing a single preliminary objection.  The complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 3222.1 of the Pennsylvania Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the city Defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act by failing to show that they had ever been cited or threatened with citation under any of the ordinances.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On January 24, 2018, the court issued an order requiring the defendants to comply with the court's order, imposing a preliminary injunction, and appointing a receiver to determine whether to proceed with the litigation.  As set forth in the order, the SEC seeks a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar against each defendant.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 10-301.13 (January 24, 2013).  The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov website to quickly identify people who are at risk of being harmed by a law enforcement action.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint charges the defendants with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 15(b)(5) of Securities Exchange Act\u00c2\u00a0Exchange Act Rules 10b2-1 and Rule 15b3-2 thereunder. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, penny stock bars, and an officer and director bar against the Defendants.
