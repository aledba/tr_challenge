  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Washington today entered a final judgment against two insurance companies for breaching their duty to defend the interests of their clients.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Snohomish County, Washington, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to properly assess the merits of the defendants\u2019 claims.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, the defendants were not entitled to reasonable attorney fees under the securities laws and instead relied on a lodestar method to determine the amount of attorney fees that should be paid to the defendants.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants were required to pay $1,147,435 in attorney fees for work that was not necessary to pursue the Bakers\u2019 insurance claims, including waste generators and transporters who, by disposing potentially hazardous waste at the landfill, may have been potentially liable parties (PLPs).  The complaint further alleges that, in a parallel action, the federal district court in Seattle issued an order requiring the defendants to pay a $1.2 million civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay civil penalties, and orders the parties to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amounts of their legal fees.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Office of Inspector General of the United States Postal Inspection Service in this matter."
