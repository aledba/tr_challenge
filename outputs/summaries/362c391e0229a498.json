  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a California-based attorney who was found to be biased in his approach to evaluating attorney fees.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, Joseph J. Schratz was appointed as an attorney under the mandatory fee arbitration provisions of the federal securities laws in 2011.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of his work as a fee auditor, he was not required to disclose to the parties that he or she had been censured 10 years earlier for conduct unrelated to his practice.  In fact, the complaint alleges, the arbitration award was based on a finding that the arbitrator had overbilled the Bocks for services that were not performed by them.  As a result, the court found that the arbitration arbitrator was biased against the Bock because of his own experience as a lawyer and experience as an arbitrator.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, SchratZ consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay $32,790 in attorney fees and a civil penalty of $425 per hour, for a total of $1,078.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Kors, Kathryn A. Curry, John O'Connor, and John R. Rymas of the San Diego Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Office of Inspector General, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
