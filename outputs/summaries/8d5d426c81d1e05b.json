  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma today entered a final judgment in favor of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission against Medicine Park Telephone Company, an Oklahoma-based telecommunications provider.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Oklahoma City, alleges that the Commission improperly denied reimbursement to Medicine Park for costs incurred to relocate its telephone facilities as required by the federal Universal Service Fund (OUSF).  According to the complaint, the Commission's order was based on a finding that the OUSF was not authorized to provide primary universal telephone service to customers in rural, insular, and high-cost areas, and that it had suffered a reduction in federal universal service fund revenues as a result of the federal order to eliminate the LSS.  Medicine Park's application, which was filed under Subsection (K)(1)(A), was entitled to reimbursement of the losses incurred by the provider, without being conditioned upon any rate case or earnings investigation by the Commission.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Medicine Park failed to produce sufficient evidence to support its request for reimbursement, and the Commission ignored the Administrator's review of the application.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Medicine Park consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000, $2,500, and $8,554 per month, respectively, for each of those costs incurred by eligible service providers.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Enforcement's Public Finance Abuse Unit, and is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Oklahoma Secretary of State's Office, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Oklahoma Department of Insurance.
