  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi yesterday entered a final judgment against Javondus Beasley, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2013 for orchestrating a triple-murder that left three women dead.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Beasley violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he acted as an unregistered broker of securities in connection with the scheme.  According to the complaint, Beasley entered the house at 10:48 p.m. on October 30, 2013, and left the house around 11:40 that same evening. The complaint alleges that he entered and exited the house after Beasley left, leaving the house with a pair of pants, and entering the house through a back door.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Beasley.  On October 31, 2018, the Honorable Paul G. Moore of the U. S. District court for the Central District of Florida issued an order suspending Beasley from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Beasley to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.  Beasley consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $25,000, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the case, the court granted Beasley's motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered a conduct-based injunction. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Mississippi State Attorney General's Office, and the Mississippi Department of Criminal Justice."
