  "summary": "On June 29, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Yuri Rozhkov, the foreign trustee of a bankruptcy proceeding in the Commercial Court of the Moscow Region against Debtor Natalia Pirogova (the \u201cRussian Insolvency Proceeding\u201d), denying her request for recognition.  According to the court's order, filed on March 29, 2019, the court improperly denied the request for a temporary restraining order against Ms.Pirogova from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15b-5 thereunder.  The court also ruled that the Russian bankruptcy proceeding was not a \"foreign main proceeding\" because Ms. Pirogov did not have a \"place of operations\" as of the date of the filing of the complaint.  In a parallel action, on June 30, 2020, the United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan issued an order denying the request to recognize the Russian insolvency proceeding as a foreign main proceeding.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, the Court held that the resolution of the case was based on the facts, not on the evidence presented by the court, and that the court had no jurisdiction over the matter at the time of the Court's order.   The Court further ruled that, based on its findings, the resolution should be deemed satisfied by the determination of the court as to whether or not the resolution is sufficient for the court to consider the merits of the matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1517(a)(1).  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of foreign insolvencies, including the potential for fraud, and issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, charges:    (i)   \u00a7 1502(b)(1) and (3)  \u00a7 1516(c)  (ii) with violations of the registration provisions of the federal securities laws, and (iii) with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and (d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-4 thereunder, and with violating Exchange Act Section 1517 (b)(2) and Exchange Act Rule 15a-3 thereunder (iii).
