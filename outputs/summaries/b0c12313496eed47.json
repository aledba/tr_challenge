  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wyoming today entered a final judgment against a Wyoming man and his Wyoming wife in a custody case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Cheyenne, Wyoming, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants were married July 26, 2008, and the court ordered them to share custody of their child until the child entered kindergarten. The court also ordered the parties to share primary custody when the child was ready to go to school. The complaint alleges that, in reality, the parties did not share custody at all. Rather, the court held that the child had a good relationship with both parents but a very close, special bond with Father.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 22, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the Defendants, charging them with violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and Section 17(a)(1) of Securities Act Section 13(b)(2)(A) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and penny stock bars against each defendant. The SEC also issued an order suspending the Defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, health, education, or other emergency relief. The defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to the issuance of an order permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws. The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about child custody, see Litigation Release No. 17-20-2-201 (Washington, D.C. 2017).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Wyoming Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the State Attorney General's Office of Criminal Investigations, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the"
