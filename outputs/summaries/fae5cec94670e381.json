  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boise, Idaho, alleges that defendant Ronnie Gene Kincaid, Jr., pleaded guilty to one count of second degree murder in the second degree and agreed to a one-year, $5,000 civil penalty.  According to the complaint, the defendant agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, and to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of five years and a $10,000 officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Kircaid.  On May 2, 2018, the Idaho Court of Appeals issued an order granting a temporary restraining order and appointing a new public defender as an attorney of record. The court granted the court's order and appointed a new attorney to handle the case.   The court also issued a preliminary injunction, which prohibits the issuance of any civil injunctive relief, including an asset freeze, and a conduct-based injunction prohibiting the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of a public company or entity, and orders the payment of a civil monetary penalty of $5.5 million.  Without further explanation, the court also granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary injunction and a hearing to determine whether to proceed with the litigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Idaho Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Idaho Department of Justice in this matter."
