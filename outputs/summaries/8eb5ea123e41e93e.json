The case was investigated by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) and the Ohio Department of Health and Human Services, and the case was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the OIG's Division of Child and Family Education.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by David J. Blakely and supervised by Jennifer C.
