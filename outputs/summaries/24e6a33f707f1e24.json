  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment against a group of for-hire drivers who filed a civil injunctive action in federal court in Seattle, Washington, alleging that they violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., on March 10, 2017, the drivers alleged that the Seattle City Council passed an Ordinance that requires all drivers to obtain business licenses and disclose much of the same information in a public and searchable municipal database online as must be disclosed pursuant to the Ordinance.  The Drivers also alleged that, in violation of Section 8(b)(4), the driver coordinator and the EDR violated the pre-enforcement provisions of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the Drivers' allegations, the city has agreed to the entry of an order permanently enjoining the driver coordinators from violating the preemption provisions.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the drivers.  On May 11, 2018, the court granted the Drivers\u2019 request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and a civil penalty against them.  To learn more about pre-emptive injunctions, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (1962).  The SEC\u2019s complaint charges the drivers with violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 and Rule 15a-3 thereunder, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar.  For further information about preemption, see Regulation No. 206 (2014) and Rule 206 (2017).  In addition, the complaint seeks a preliminary injunction against future violations of the securities laws, an officer and director bar, a penny stock bar, and other emergency relief.  It also seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions against future actions by the Department of Finance and Administrative Services (DFCA) and the Seattle Police Department, as well as civil penalties against the Drivers.  Among other things, the SEC is seeking a court order halting the issuance, purchase, offer of, and sale of any automobile, truck, or other vehicle that is not registered with the DFCA.  Additionally, the Commission has issued an order suspending the issuance and purchase of any car, trucking company, automobile dealer, municipal securities dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.   The Commission's investigation was conducted by Jennifer Immel, Gary Kunze, and Michael Riebs, and was supervised by"
