  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered judgment against John Blue, a case manager and investigator with the Georgia Department of Family and Child Services, on his malicious-prosecution claim.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on June 12, 2014, Blue and his girlfriend, Zstanya Patrick, were living with their two sons, who were 14 and 10 years old, when Blue and Patrick allegedly engaged in a domestic violence incident. Blue allegedly told the officers that he was going to separate from his girlfriend and move with her sons to Ohio, and that he would use his van to \"push\" off Lopez's car. The complaint alleges that Blue replied that he did not know of Lopez's official capacity when he saw the two women speaking together. Blue also allegedly claimed to base his belief on what he described as Lopez\u2019s flushed face and on his alleged observation of the IV dangling from her arm. The SEC alleges that the SEC found that Blue could not establish a sufficient basis for a directed verdict in a criminal case because he was a government defendant, and he had no interest in getting his children away from Lopez. The court ultimately granted the SEC summary judgment against Blue.  The SEC complaint charges Blue with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Blue has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice announced criminal charges against Blue on June 13, 2014. The Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about potential scams targeting investors in the securities industry.  Investors should be aware that SEC filings often include false and misleading information about whether a defendant is entitled to qualified immunity from unreasonable seizures, and the SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by\u00c2\u00a0using\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's Investor.gov website to identify whether they are registered professionals."
