  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Tamra Knudson in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Florida.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Williams County, New York, alleges that, in 2016, the district court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Tamra from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a $280,000 spousal support obligation.  According to the complaint, the court improperly included in her self-employment income an oil and gas lease bonus and a $100,000 lease bonus she received in 2016 because it was non-recurring income and was not paid to her for services she provided to the farm.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Child and Family Education today announced that it has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check whether they are registered professionals by using the Investor Alert feature on\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether investments in a particular investment are eligible for investment in a specific investment.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint charges Tamra with violating Section 15(a)(1) and Rule 15a-3 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Tamra has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering her to disgorge her ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Tamra also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, with the right to reapply after five years. The court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, ordered Tamra to pay disgorgement of $403 per month in child support, and issued an order requiring her to comply with a court order appointing a receiver to determine the amount of child support owed to Tamra. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar against Tamra, as well as an order prohibiting her from participating in any offering of any investment in any investment that constitutes a \"permanent investment.\" The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
