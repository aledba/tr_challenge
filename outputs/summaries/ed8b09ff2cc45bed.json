  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Joseph A. Equale, Jr. and Anthony W. Cirone, Jr., of Bethel, Connecticut, ordering them to pay $740,783 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Bethel on September 19, 2016, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that Equale and Cirone violated the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(2)(A) and (c) thereunder of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions, orders them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Connecticut today announced criminal charges against the defendants.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the New York office by John Rymas of the Market Abuse Unit, and the case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Connecticut Office of Financial Regulation, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Connecticut Department of Health and Human Services."
