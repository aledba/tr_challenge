  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a financial planner and adviser charged with defrauding elderly parents out of millions of dollars.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that Leslie Gould and his wife, Susan Gould, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Gould and her husband misappropriated funds from the Gould Living Trust, of which she was the trustee, and misused the funds for personal expenses.  As alleged, the complaint alleges that in February and March 2013, the Goulds informed the CFP Board that they were considering filing a civil injunctive action against Cross-complainant.  In a parallel action, on July 22, 2014, a federal district court in Los Angeles entered a temporary restraining order and ordered Cross-Complainant to return the allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest and pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his disgorgement and prejudgment interest.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay civil penalties of $10,000 each, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty.  On August 25, 2014 the U. S. District Judge for the Southern District of New York granted the Commission on Financial Regulation's (CFPB) request for an emergency asset freeze and an asset freeze, and ordered the Commission to determine whether to issue an order imposing the asset freeze as part of its investigation.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the San Diego Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, with the assistance of the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations' Risk Analysis Task Force. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson, and the case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Insurance, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and any other government agency, company, or person that could possibly interfere with Cross-Complainant's ability to engage in his profession."
