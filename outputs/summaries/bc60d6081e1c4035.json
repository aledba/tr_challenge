  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio today entered a final judgment in favor of a class action settlement against a defendant for defrauding investors in a penny stock company.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on May 23, 2018, filed in federal district court in the District of Columbia, defendants agreed to settle the litigation by paying $7,188,846.25 in attorneys' fees, $41,194.77 in expenses, and $3,000 in service awards for each of the two named plaintiffs.  The complaint alleges that defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that defendants are entitled to a percentage-of-the-fee award based on the number of attorneys' hours spent on the litigation.  In addition, the complaint alleges defendants failed to provide sufficient documentation to determine whether they were entitled to an attorney's fee award based upon the value of the attorney's work performed.  For example, as alleged in the complaint, defendants' total hours expended on this litigation was approximately 5,196.44, comprised of $1,728,912.50 in historical lodestar and $750,000 of service awards.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay $7.188 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of up to $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael R. Kasper and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Department of Insurance, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0search tool to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed a complaint on May 24, 2018 alleging that defendants defrauded investors in penny stock companies by falsely claiming that their fees would be paid in a \"reasonable and appropriate\" manner.
