  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against Indiana residents L.M. (\u201cMother\u201d) and Sa.S., who are charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also issued a temporary restraining order and ordered the return of the children to their respective parent-child relationships.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on June 1, 2016, Mother and Father were notified by DCS that their child had been removed from their home and placed in relative care with their father. The complaint alleges that Mother refused to take a drug screen and Father tested positive for methamphetamine, amphetamine, and/or THC since the inception of the child's relationship with the child.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Mother and father.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against each of them. The final judgments also order the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of their disgorgements, and impose an officer-and-director bar.  On the same day, the court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations, and the defendants agreed to pay civil penalties of $15,000 each. The defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the federal anti-fraud laws, to be barred from serving as officers or directors of a public company, and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-based security-related product. The settlements are subject to court approval. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Mr. Gaunt. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Indiana Department of Children and Family Services, the Indianapolis Office of Child and Family Education, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Department of Health and Human Services Criminal Justice, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, the Office of the Attorney General, and a Division of Criminal Justice."
