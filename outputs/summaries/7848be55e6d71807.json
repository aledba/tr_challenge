  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against two former members of a Chicago condominium association for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that Maria Arcos, Rachel Owens, and Omar R. Castro, former directors of the Cal-Full Condominium Association, failed to produce books and records related to the association's failure to produce them.  According to the complaint, Arcos and Owens misappropriated $51,500 in investor funds to pay for the building's construction and remodeling.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the Ruizes misrepresented to investors that the association was governed by two associations, one commercial and one residential, and failed to state a cause of action for their failure to comply with the requirements of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Ruises consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits.  Additionally, the court granted the Ruize's motion for summary judgment on the basis that it was satisfied that the defendants had not breached their fiduciary duties by failing to provide the investors with sufficient information to determine whether they were entitled to attorney fees based on the information contained in the complaint.   The court's order also prohibits the defendants from seeking to bar them from serving as officers or directors of a publicly-traded company. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay in the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Secretary of State's Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Attorney General's Office in this matter."
