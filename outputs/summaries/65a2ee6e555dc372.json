  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the California Department of Juvenile Justice's (DJCJ) motion for a temporary restraining order against future violations of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, alleges that, in November 2016, California voters passed a law that raised the minimum age at which a child can be tried as an adult from 14 to 16. The court ruled that the new law violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that it violated the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933. The Court also found that, contrary to the stated intent of the law, SB 1391 was inconsistent with DJCJ's registration provisions.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern and Northern Districts of California announced today that it filed criminal charges against B.M., alleging that he had committed a serious and violent felony when he was 14 or 15. The complaint also alleged that, based on the evidence presented in the court's opinion, that the defendants had diminished culpability and greater prospects of redemption when they were released from prison, and therefore were less deserving of the most severe punishments.  According to the SEC's Complaint, the court found that DJCj violated Section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act of 1940 and Rule 5b2-3 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The case is being handled by Lara Lara, Mark Levin, and Eric Werner of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Lara and supervised by Mr. Levin. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Department of Justice, the California Attorney General's Office, and the U. S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office of Northern California and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
