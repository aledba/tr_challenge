  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia on October 26, 2016, entered a final judgment against Hi-Tech Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Georgia-based company that manufactures, markets, and sells dietary supplements.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Atlanta on Oct. 26, 2015, the company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Allmax Nutrition, Inc. (Allmax), raised three issues with the court. First, the complaint alleges that the company failed to disclose that it had established the true protein content of HexaPro using a test that complies with the federal dietary supplement regulations. The complaint further alleges that, contrary to the company's representations, the product is not made solely of free-form amino acids and non-protein ingredients, and that it contains only 17.914 grams of the \"Blend\"-type protein per serving.  The SEC's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, orders the company to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The court also granted the company a temporary restraining order, which prohibits it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement of $5,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a $100,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains the defendants' liability for the alleged violations of the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern Districts of Georgia today announced criminal charges against the company.  On October 27, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Allmax, charging it with violations of Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1940, and an order requiring the defendants to pay civil penalties of $150,000 or more.  To learn more about the anti-fraud provisions, see Food and Drug Abuse Task Force (FDA Task Force) and SEC Litigation Release (LIT) No. 17-cv-101.9(a) (2014).  The complaint also names Allmax as a defendant in violation of Section 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(c) thereunder of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a"
