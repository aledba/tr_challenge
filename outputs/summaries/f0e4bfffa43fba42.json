  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a group of companies that sought to restructure under bankruptcy law.  The court entered the final judgment in favor of the companies, which agreed to pay $1.46 billion in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  According to the court's order, filed on April 29, 2016, the companies voluntarily petitioned for reorganization under Chapter 11 bankruptcy law in 2016.  In its judgment, the court found that the companies were not impaired by the bankruptcy provisions of the federal securities laws, and that they were entitled to post-petition interest at the time the bankruptcy court issued its judgment.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the bankruptcy law does not require a creditor to pay a pre-commitment interest at a certain rate. Rather, it requires the creditor to show that he or she has repaid the amount owed to the debtor in the bankruptcy proceeding.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendants agreed to settle the matter by agreeing to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay pre-judgment interest of 0.1% at the federal judgment rate. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority."
