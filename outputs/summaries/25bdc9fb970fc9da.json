  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada today entered a final judgment in favor of Johnson, finding him liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Las Vegas, Nevada, alleges that Johnson violated his rights under the federal securities laws by failing to timely respond to a court order denying his motion for a new trial.  According to the complaint, Johnson failed to adequately respond to the court\u2019s order denying him access to certain of the defendants\u2019 bank accounts.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the court failed to determine whether the defendants were entitled to a fair and just hearing.  Johnson also failed to provide any evidence to support his claim that the district court violated his due-process rights by not requiring him to provide a reasonable estimate of the loss to the bank.  As a result, the court ultimately granted Johnson a temporary restraining order preventing him from making any further statements to the public, including without admitting or denying the allegations in his opening brief, and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  On the same day, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Johnson, charging him with violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 and Rule 15a-3 thereunder, and for failing to comply with the court order that he forfeited his right to a hearing on the merits of the case.  To learn more about the SEC's investigation, see Litigation Release Release Release Order No. 17-1014 (2010).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Johnson arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint.   The complaint charges Johnson with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Johnson.  Without admitting to these violations, Johnson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, and orders him to repay the amount of his penalty in a civil monetary proceeding, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Additionally, Johnson agreed to a five-year bar from appearing before the SEC as an attorney and to the appointment of a receiver for the purpose of recovering stolen bank funds.  He also agreed to pay civil penalties of $250,000,"
