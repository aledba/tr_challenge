  "summary": "On August 29, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of West Virginia entered a final judgment ordering the return of parental rights to three of the children.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson County, W.Va., the mother of three children who were abused and neglected by her husband, M.L., gave birth to a fourth child shortly before the court entered the final disposition order.  The complaint alleges that the mother failed to make the necessary changes to maintain the level of care her children received during the course of her abuse and neglect proceeding.  As alleged in the complaint, the mother continued to take Subutex even after she was told that her husband was going to kill her.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the mother and father of the three children, who were also abused and neglect.  To learn more about mother-and-child custody, see Litigation Release No. 565, 518 S.E.2d. (2014).  The SEC's Complaint alleges that, in addition to failing to comply with the court\u2019s order, the defendant failed to provide sufficient evidence to justify the termination of her parental rights.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  On August 31, the court granted the defendants\u2019 request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from violating the anti-abuse provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordered the mother to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.   The court also granted the defendant the right to return the children to their mother.  A hearing on August 30, 2018 was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. EST for the purpose of reviewing the progress of the child custody proceeding."
