  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered final judgments against the City of Austin and Briarwood Armstrong, LLC in a case that was investigated by the Texas Department of Public Finance.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, alleges that the city violated the antifraud provisions of Section 2206 of the Texas Constitution and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, in violation of Section 206 of the Exchange Act, the city failed to disclose that it had obtained an easement to construct a cross-access drive on the property. The SEC further alleges that in a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office and the Texas Secretary of State's Office issued false and misleading statements in connection with the taking of the easement.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed on October 7, 2017, the court of appeals found that Austin violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(3) of its Exchange Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and that Austin acted in bad faith and capricious fashion by failing to consider the merits of the city's action. The court also found that the City violated Section 206 (1) of that Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Austin consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the city from violating these provisions, and orders the city to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a related matter, the Court of Appeals also issued a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the City from issuing or selling any security or other security-related documents, including documents and records, without requiring the City to provide an accounting of the risks and benefits of any such security or security measure. The Court also issued an order suspending the issuance of a cease-and-desist order and ordering the City Attorney's Office to conduct an investigation into the matter.  On November 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the city, charging it with violating Section 206, and ordering it to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the court. The case is being handled by Scott A. Mascianica, Eric R. Werner, and David A. Schiff of the Dallas Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the United States Secret Service in this matter."
