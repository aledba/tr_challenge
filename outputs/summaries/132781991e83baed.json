  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment in favor of the Cooks in a timber trespass case.  The court found that the Cookes violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also found that, contrary to the defendants\u2019 representations to the court, the defendants acted willfully and without probable cause in not enforcing the height restriction on their property.  In its judgment, the court held that the defendants were entitled to attorney fees and costs based on their successful prosecution of their timber trespass claim.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court\u2019s order, Twu consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay $2,005.00 in disgorgement and $15,392 in prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $10,000.  Twu also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and to pay a $20,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  According to the SEC's order, filed in federal district court in Tacoma, Washington, the parties agreed to settle the matter by agreeing to pay over $2.5 million in attorney fees, $1 million in civil penalties, and $1.2 million in fees. The settlement also provides for Twu to obtain attorney fees on appeal from the defendants, and for the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,500 each.  On May 2, 2019, the SEC issued an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue an injunction against Twu and her husband, Mark Martel, in violation of Section 5 of the Exchange Act. The receiver agreed to the appointment of a receiver that would determine the appropriate height restriction for the receiver.  As part of the settlement, the receiver will be able to determine the height of the trees on his or her property at a later date.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 4-84-253 (2014).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
