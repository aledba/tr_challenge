  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against Indiana Secretary of State Bradley King and Attorney Angela Nussmeyer in a civil injunctive action brought by the League of Women Voters of Indiana.  The court entered the final judgment on consent against the defendants, which permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar.  According to the court's order, King and Nussmey agreed to settle the case by consenting to permanent injunctions against violations of the federal registration laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced parallel criminal charges against the Defendants.  On May 2, 2018, the court granted the SEC's request for a preliminary injunction against the implementation of Section 542 of the National Voter Registration Act of 1940, which requires states to maintain accurate and current voter registration rolls. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Indianapolis, charges the defendants with violating Section 532 of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction from the Defendants, a civil penalty from the court, and an officer-and-director bar. The court also granted the defendants' motion for preliminary injunctions from future violations of Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act, which provides for the appointment of an officer and director of a registered organization.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgments permanently enjoining them from violations of Sections 542, and ordering them to disgorge their gains, pay prejudgment interests, and pay civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 542 (August 23, 2017).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Indiana Secretary's Office, and the Indiana Department of State Office of Inspector General."
