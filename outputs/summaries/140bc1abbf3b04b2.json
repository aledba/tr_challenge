  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against West Bend Mutual Insurance Company (WBCI) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on December 1, 2014, West Bend agreed to defend Krishna in a civil action brought by L.A. Tan Enterprises, Inc. (Krishna), alleging that Krishna violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose her biometric information to a third party.  The complaint alleges that West Bend violated the securities laws because it failed to adequately protect Krishna in the underlying litigation.  In its judgment, the court found that WBCI had a duty to defend against Krishna in its complaint, and that it had to do so by providing a copy of Ms. Sekura's biometric data to an out-of-state third party without her knowledge or consent.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, KBCI consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On January 18, 2017, a federal district court in Chicago issued a judgment ordering West Bend to comply with the court's order, ordering it to provide coverage for Krishna in an underlying civil action, and to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  West Bend has agreed to settle the case against it by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c).  The judgment also orders that the amount of any civil penalty to be determined by the court at a later date.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Rollin M. Perkins and Ronald N. Boyce of the Chicago Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Illinois Attorney General's Office in this matter."
