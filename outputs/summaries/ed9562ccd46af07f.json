  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former coil helper for Howard Industries, Inc., a Tennessee-based manufacturer of paper extension machines.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Michelle M. McKenzie suffered a work-related neck injury while operating a paper extension machine at Howard Industries.  According to the complaint, McKenzie was injured while operating the machine and suffered a 10% loss of wage-earning capacity.  After recovering from her injury, McKenzie filed a workers' compensation claim against Howard Industries on June 28, 2018, alleging that she suffered permanent disability from injury arising out of and in the course of her work.  As alleged in the SEC's order, McKenzie's injuries were not preventable, and she was not required to perform the job as she did pre-injury.  In addition, the complaint alleges that McKenzie returned to work after her injury and was able to increase her own wages by working overtime hours and earning additional compensation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, McKenzie consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $12.56 per hour, $13.01 per hour for a period of 450 weeks, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (Feb. 23, 2012).  The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David H. Humphrey, John Risher, and Amy Gwiazda of the Atlanta Regional Office, with assistance from John Rymas of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, and is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alabama Department of Insurance, and the Tennessee Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
