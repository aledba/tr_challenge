  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the City of San Diego on consent for failing to produce documents related to a city-ordered records request.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles on March 8, 2016, Ponani Sukumar, a resident of a San Diego, California home, complained to the City that it had not produced all of the previously requested documents.  The complaint alleges that the City failed to produce the requested documents because Sukumar's attorney, Sharren Carr, had requested that the city produce them.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the City did not produce any responsive documents until the complaint was filed.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Sukumar.  On May 11, the court granted the city's request for an attorney fee and ordered the city to produce additional documents in response to the complaint.  Sukumar consented to the court's order, without admitting or denying the allegations, to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay $925.28 for the search and destruction of documents and $5,390 for the cost of his attorney's office's examination of the records.  Carr also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Kelly L. Gibson of the Los Angeles Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Enforcement's Public Finance Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the California Department of Justice in this matter."
