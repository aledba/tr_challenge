  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against American Airlines Group, Inc. (\"AAG\") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, American Airlines, Inc., in a civil injunctive action.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York on June 18, 2019, Scanlan alleges that he and other similarly situated employees were wrongfully deprived of certain rights and benefits under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\") while on short-term military leave.  The complaint further alleges that the defendants failed to include as eligible earnings their imputed income when calculating their profit sharing awards.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Scanlan was not entitled to compensation for work not performed while on military leave because he was absent from work for jury duty, sick leave, and union leave, nor did he receive any compensation for his missed work days.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 4316(b)(1) of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office, and is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."
