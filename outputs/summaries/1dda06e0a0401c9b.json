  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Massachusetts yesterday entered a final judgment against a defendant in a defamation case brought by Samia El-Moslimany and Ann Sindi.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, alleges that Samia and her husband, Fouad Dehlawi, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Samia's husband, who was a visiting scholar at the time of the trial, repeatedly lied about her age in order to obtain awards meant for younger scientists.  Samia also allegedly claimed that Dr. Sindi lacked the prerequisite scientific or technical prowess to have written her dissertation, and that she had difficulty in recruiting investors for the i2 Institute.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their ill-gotten gains.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Samia for her role in the alleged scheme.  On October 6, 2016, the Honorable Judge Robert E. Curran granted the SEC a temporary restraining order and ordered Samia to pay a civil penalty of $720,000.  Curran agreed to the same monetary penalty as the district court, and agreed to a permanent injunction, which is subject to court approval.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of five years.  To settle the case, the court will determine whether to impose a civil injunctive relief order, impose a $100,000 civil penalty, and appoint a receiver to oversee the receiver's operations.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (1962).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Boston Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify people who are at risk of being harmed by a defendant's alleged misconduct."
