  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against the City of Springfield and its attorney, Mark G. Weinberg, in a civil rights case brought by two Chicago residents.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order and an order freezing the assets of the defendants.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago on June 27, 2014, Weinberg and his attorney, Adele D. Nicholas, raised the issue of reasonable attorney's fees in a public proceeding by claiming they were ticketed and arrested numerous times for violating the city's ban on panhandling in the downtown historic district of Springfield. The complaint alleges that the city violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Weinberg violated the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) of that federal securities law. The SEC's order freezes the defendants' assets and orders them to pay $417,288.50 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Weinberg.  On November 4, 2013, the court granted a preliminary injunction against the city from enforcing the ordinance and ordered Weinberg to pay a $400,000 civil penalty in the amount of $375,000.  Weinberg agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Illinois on October 25, 2013 alleging that the Chicago City Attorney violated the anti-panhandling provisions of the federal securities laws by charging a reasonable hourly rate for an attorney in violation of the First Amendment, and by failing to provide sufficient evidence to justify the charging of a reasonable rate for the attorney in the public proceeding.  To further illustrate the importance of this finding, the Department of Justice today announced that it has obtained a court order freezing Weinberg's assets"
