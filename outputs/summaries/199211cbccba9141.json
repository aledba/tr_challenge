  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against Kansas City Public Schools' (KCPS) motion for a temporary restraining order against Baldridge.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, Missouri, alleges that in 2002, Baldridge was assigned as a school guidance counselor at an alternative school program for students who were suspended from classes for short or long-term periods.  According to the complaint, while working as a paraprofessional at the program Baldridge had to use a speakerphone in a room where he would be overheard by other students.  Baldridge's disability prevented him from using the speakerphone during certain times of the day, and he was unable to access the computer.  In a parallel action, on June 10, 2016, the Missouri Department of Education (Mo. App. W.D. 2013) issued an order suspending Baldridge from appearing or practicing before the court as a representative of the school district.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the court granted the motion for an injunction, ordered Baldridge to comply with the court's order, and ordered him to pay $230,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a $1,000 civil penalty.  On June 13, 2017, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court in Jackson County alleging that Baldridge violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the complaint seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  Further, the complaint charges Baldridge with violating the anti-harassment provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0The\u00c2\u00a0Adviser and Counseling Services Act of 1940 and Rule\u00c2\u00a0206(4)-8 thereunder.  It also seeks a court-ordered injunction, the imposition of a civil penalty, and the return of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest from Baldridge in the form of a penny stock bar against him.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 206 (2) of June 12, 2014.   The complaint also names as a relief defendant that the court will determine whether or not to impose a penalty based on the facts of the case. \u00c2\u00a0In its order, the Court also ordered the SEC to conduct a hearing on the merits of the matter before it was decided whether to order a new trial.  Among other things, the order requires the SEC"
