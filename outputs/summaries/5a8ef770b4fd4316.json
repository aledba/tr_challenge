  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against a Pennsylvania man accused of engaging in child abuse.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that, on February 3, 2016, a father and mother used a belt to restrain their four-year-old son after they found the child writing on the apartment walls.  According to the complaint, the spanking was so severe that the child's bottom began to hurt and he began to cry.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services (DOH) today announced that it has issued an order suspending the father from participating in any form of child abuse, including corporal punishment, for five days.  On February 9, 2016 and again on February 9 and again the following day, the complaint alleges that the father spanked Child with an open hand, hit the child on the bottom with his open fist, and then continued to spank Child.  As alleged, the child was not injured and did not complain of pain.   The complaint charges the father with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the father has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  He has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school for five years, and to a five-year officer and director bar. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Philadelphia Regional Office by staff of the Office of Children, Youth and Families (OCHF).  The case has been supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the OCHF's Office of Advocacy and Advocacy, and the case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Philadelphia Office of Child and Family Education, the Department of Public Welfare, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Pennsylvania Office of Inspector General (PIO) in this matter."
