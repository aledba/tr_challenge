  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered final judgments against Personal Care Products, Inc., a Texas-based medical equipment provider, and the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, ordering it to pay $2.165 million in overpayments.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Austin, Texas, alleges that in 2006, the Texas Department of Insurance and Health Care Services Commission audited Medicaid claims submitted from 2004 to 2005 for services that were not covered by the agency's policies.  According to the complaint, the Commission's findings were inconsistent with the representations made by the Commission, and were not supported by substantial evidence presented to the court.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the Commission failed to provide sufficient notice of the overpayment, the amount of over payments, the extrapolation methodology employed by the commission, the calculation of overpayment by the individual, the number of claims received by the provider, the accuracy of the data, the timing and manner of the Commission&HSC's final judgment, or the nature of the violations alleged by the complaint.  As a result, the final judgment imposed a partial hold on payments due to personal care products for the years at issue, which resulted in an overpayment of $2,165,115.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the SEC&HHS Commission&hrs.gov administrative proceeding, the court granted the Commission &HHS' request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2)(A) and 5(b)(3)(B) and (c) thereunder of the Administrative Procedure Act of 1940 and Rule 5b2-1 thereunder.  Additionally, the Court granted the request for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15a-1 and Rule 15b-2 thereunder and the right to reapply as a matter of law upon request.    The Commission&hr.gov Administrative Action Task Force has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission&rs.'s complaint also alleges that, based on its findings, HHSC should have provided timely and reasonable notice of any overpayment before it issued the First Amended Notice.
