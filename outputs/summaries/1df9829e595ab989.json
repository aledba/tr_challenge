  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Orleans today entered a final judgment against the estate of a Ruston, Louisiana forestry consultant who was permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court granted the estate's request for a temporary restraining order and an attorney fee.  According to the court's order, filed on June 13, 2014, Tom Bourland executed a promissory note in favor of his wife, Melodye Tanner, for $200,000 in June 2014. The note was unsecured, and the amount due to Ms. Tanner was $162,000. The court found that the note was not in authentic form and could not support executory process.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the judgment, Mr. Bourland consented to the entry of a final Judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 17 (a) and (b)(5) of Securities Act Section 13(b)(2)(A) and Rules 12b-20 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and orders him to pay $15,421.50 in attorney fees. The judgment also prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the dissolution of a TRO or preliminary injunction. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana today announced criminal charges against Mr. Tanner. The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov website to quickly and easily identify people selling investments using the search tool.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint alleges that: (1) Mr. and Mrs. Tanner violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\"). (2) The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. (3) The complaint seeks a preliminary injunction against future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 16(a)(3) and 17(b), and seeks a judgment ordering the seizure and sale of the property. (4) The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
