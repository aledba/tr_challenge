  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland on May 30, 2017 entered a final judgment in favor of the parties in a divorce case.  The court's order, which was entered on May 31, 2017, ordered the parties to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million, $1 million, and $1,500, respectively.  According to the order, the court improperly calculated the marital share of a retired military pension by using the standard retired pay multiplier, which is 2.5 times the value of a member's retired pay at the time of the divorce.  As alleged in the complaint, this calculation was incorrect because it improperly divided the member's retirement pension by the number of years they were married.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Christopher Fulgium, alleging that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay civil penalties of $2 million each, and bars them from serving as officers or directors of a public company for five years, and from participating in the issuance of any officer-and-director pension plan. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Kristy N. Kamarck and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. McKinley. The case is being supervised by Lara S. Mehraban.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Maryland Secretary of State's Office, the Department of Justice, and the Maryland Department of Banking and Securities."
