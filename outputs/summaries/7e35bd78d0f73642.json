  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado today entered a final judgment against Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (\"Walgreens\") for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, Colorado, on June 6, 2017, the court found that the pre-verdict evidentiary component of the collateral source rule applies only to medical services provided to a Medicare beneficiary, not to any other person, corporation, insurance company, or fund.  The court also ruled that, as alleged in the complaint, the amount of any collateral source payment that a person received from a provider falls within the scope of the federal law.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Forfar.   The SEC's Complaint alleges that, in its complaint filed in the federal district court for the district of Colorado, the defendants failed to show sufficient evidence to show that they were liable above the Medicare limits for medical services rendered.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amounts of $72,636 and $1,829, respectively.  Defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to permanent injunctions and to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $75,000, respectively, against each of them. The settlement is pending final approval by the court. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Colorado Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
