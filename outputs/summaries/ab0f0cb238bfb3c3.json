  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin today entered a final judgment against two insurance companies for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Wisconsin, alleges that Zurich Insurance Company and Taian Insurance Company, Ltd., a Wisconsin-based insurance company, violated the federal securities laws by failing to provide sufficient minimum contacts with the state of Wisconsin.  According to the complaint, Swiss Insurance Company was liable for liability and defense costs incurred by Trek in Texas, while Taian was not a party to Trek\u2019s litigation.  Zurich, Taian, and Lexington Insurance Company also were not parties to a duty-to-defend clause in their insurance policies, and neither Zurich nor Taian had any jurisdiction over Trek in the forum state.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants never made any purposeful contact with Wisconsin or any other state where Trek incurred liability.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes civil penalties against each of them.   The judgment also orders the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000, which is equal to the amount that they will disgorge in the future. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Illinois, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Wisconsin Department of Insurance, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Wisconsin Office of Insurance Regulation (OIEA) in this matter."
