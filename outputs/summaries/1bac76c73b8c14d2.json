  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against a defendant and ordered him or her to pay $189,574.33 in restitution.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that Allan Bruun and James Diderickson violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by writing a series of unauthorized checks on Tivoli Properties LLC's business checking account that did not appear to be related to the development of the property.  According to the complaint, the defendants also failed to persuade the district court to impose complete restitution upon the victims.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to inform victims that the checks were unauthorized and that they were liable to pay a full restitution amount.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains or halts their liability for the alleged violations of the securities laws, and the settlement agreement is subject to court approval.   The complaint also alleges that Defendants violated Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 5b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").   In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Utah today announced criminal charges against the defendants. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and whether they have any background in law enforcement.  For example, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Division of Securities and Exchange Commission and the Utah Office of Insurance Regulation in this matter."
