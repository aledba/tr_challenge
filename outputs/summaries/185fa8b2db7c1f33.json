  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Willie Lampley, a Beaumont, Texas man who was convicted of possession of child pornography.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, in fall 2017, a federal district court for the southern district of New Jersey, entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 210 months and 120 months, with the amount of disgorgement to be determined by the court at a later date.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced that it filed criminal charges against the defendant.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed on September 5, 2018, the court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendant to return to his home and show the videos to the jury.  On September 6, 2018 the court issued an order permanently enjoining the government from violating the antiphasing provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently restrains the defendants from violating these provisions and orders them to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $100,000, respectively, for each of those violations.  Lamplely also agreed to be permanently enjoined from associating with any person with whom he had a prior conviction in a felony-possession-of-a-firearm prosecution, and to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, electronic device, including a smartphone, computer, tablet, or other electronic device. The court also granted the government the right to display the videos on its website, without requiring the jury to determine whether they were child pornography or not. The SEC also requested that the jury consider the merits of the case, including whether it was reasonable to believe that the defendant had access to the images and videos and whether he had the knowledge and ability to access and use the technology to detect and detect such material.  Among other things, the Court found that the defendants did not knowingly download or share child pornography and that they did not use the internet to view the videos. The Court also found that, contrary to the representations of the defendants, the defendants used the internet for their own purposes, including to search for \"child pornography\" on the internet and to \"check out\" such items."
