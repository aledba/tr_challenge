  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered default judgment against six defendants for their roles in a BitTorrent swarm that resulted in the unauthorized download and/or distribution of the motion picture Boyka Undisputed 4.  According to the court's order, the defendants directly or indirectly shared, downloaded, and distributed a single unique copy of the movie over the Internet through a peer-to-peer network using the BitTorrent protocol.  The court found that the defendants were all part of the same \"swarm\" of users that reproduced, distributed, and performed the copyrighted work.  As alleged in the complaint, these users were not the same as the defendants.  In addition, the Court found that, based on the nature of the alleged infringement, each defendant is jointly and severally liable for the amount of attorney time spent pursuing his or her infringement.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $1,388.00, with attorney's fees and costs in excess of $158.00. The court also granted the defendants' requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the allegedly ill-gotten gains with respect to the alleged damages.  Finally, the court entered default against each defendant on the basis of a finding that it found reasonable and warranted by the SEC in its order granting default judgment to each defendant.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Los Angeles Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FINCA), and the U.K. Secret Service in this matter."
