  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that in March 2016, Child reported to an extended family member that Father had performed oral sex on her when she was eight years old. The complaint alleges that the court terminated Father\u2019s parental rights on the basis of a finding that he had failed to provide reasonable efforts to provide reunification services to her and her younger sister. The court also ordered that Father participate in individual therapy, group therapy with other sexual offenders, and a psycho-sexual skills course.  According to the complaint, however, Father did not participate in those sessions because he was under the influence of alcohol and drugs at the time he committed the act.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for Utah today announced criminal charges against Father. The SEC also announced that it would seek a permanent injunction against Father from violating its prior order to terminate his parental rights.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Father consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The final judgment also prohibits Father from participating in any form of family reunification, including by providing a copy of the court order or by providing an attorney or other proof of a prior court order.  On May 2, 2018, the court granted a temporary restraining order against Father and ordered him to comply with the court's order for him to participate in reunification and to provide independent housing. On May 4, 2018 the court issued an order requiring the court to consider the merits of Father's claims in its order for the termination of parental rights, and ordered that he submit to random drug and alcohol testing. The order also requires him to provide an explanation for why he did not comply with court-ordered treatment recommendations and that he must provide a \"citation to the record showing that the issue was adequately resolved\" to achieve the objectives of the Child and Family Plan.  It also requires that Father comply with a court order requiring him to complete a parental fitness and psycho- sexual evaluation before proceeding with the reunification.   The court granted the order for Father to provide information about his progress in therapy and domestic violence treatment to DCFS."
