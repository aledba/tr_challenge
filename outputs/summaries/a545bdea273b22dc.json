  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama today entered a final judgment against a Montgomery County, Alabama man who was convicted of two counts of capital murder and sentenced to death for his role in the death of a Montgomery Police Officer.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, alleges that on September 28, 2006, Judge Truman Hobbs summarily dismissed all but one of Woodward's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.  According to the complaint, Hobbs had previously agreed to the death penalty without admitting or denying the allegations in Woodward's petition.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency and to pay a civil penalty of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Hobbs failed to adequately investigate and present mitigating evidence in the case.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the court improperly dismissed all of the defendants' claims that he was not prejudiced by counsel's failure to present sufficient evidence to justify his decision to recuse himself from the proceeding.  For example, the SEC alleges that Judge Hobbs was not under any type of political pressure when he sentenced Woodward to death, and that he did not have the burden of proof to determine whether he was entitled to recusal.  On the other hand, the Court found that the defendant was not entitled to a fair and impartial hearing based on the facts presented in the complaint.  It also found that, in a parallel action, the Alabama Attorney General's Office filed a civil injunctive action against Hobbs, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the reporting provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The SEC also charged Hobbs with acting as an unregistered broker-dealer in violation of Section 13(a) of Exchange Act Rule 12b-20, and aiding and abetting Hobbs's violations of Section 17(a)(2) of Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rules 12b2-1 and 12b3-2 thereunder and with violating Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b-1 thereunder; and, as to Hobbs' role as a trial judge, as a result of his failure to adequately evaluate the evidence presented in his motion for discovery.   The complaint also alleges that the court failed to consider the merits of the defendant's motion for recusal, including the fact that the trial judge was ineffective"
