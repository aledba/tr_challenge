  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered final judgments against seven California-based restaurant defendants for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, Applebee's International, Inc. (Applebee's), McDonald's Corporation (McDonald's), and Chick-fil-A, Inc.'s (KFC) failed to post clear and reasonable warnings of the health risks of grilled chicken products.  The complaint alleges that the defendants did not post the warnings in all of the purchase areas of all of their retail establishments.  In addition, the complaint alleged that none of the restaurants posted the Safe Harbor warning, and that KFC did not properly post the warning in the drive-through ordering area of 13 restaurants.    The SEC alleges that, contrary to the representations in the complaint, none of these restaurants had posted the safe Harbor warning and that neither of these warnings was sufficient to justify a civil injunctive action.  Finally, the court found that the complaint was not supported by sufficient evidence to support a reasonable and meritorious case for a civil injunction, and ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Los Angeles Regional Office, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay of the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit. The SEC's litigation will be led by Jennifer Chun Barry and Ms. Chun Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
