  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against defendant Jose Luis Leon, Jr., who was convicted of two counts of capital murder and one count of attempted murder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Leon and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, Leon, then a resident of Mexico City, made a series of false statements to the FBI in connection with his alleged role in the murders.  In one instance, Leon allegedly told the FBI that he would tell the FBI if he understood the Miranda provisions of the federal securities laws.  He also allegedly told FBI agents that he was going to the Ragland house and would \"find a way to end their relationship.\"  The SEC alleges that Leon did not know or care that the FBI had obtained a copy of the Miranda instructions.  Instead, he allegedly used the information provided by the FBI to justify his actions.  As alleged in the complaint, Leon was not capable of understanding or agreeing to the requirements of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Leon consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933.  Leon also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the United States.  On May 2, 2018, the court granted a motion for summary judgment against Leon, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and ordering a civil injunction against further violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1.  A hearing on May 4, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Scott A. Thompson of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Office of Inspector General, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."
