  "summary": "On October 4, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against Tug Construction, LLC, a Seattle, Washington, limited liability company, for breach of the Bareboat Charter.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle on April 29, 2019 and unsealed on May 13, 2020, Tug construction and its owner, Harley Marine Services, Inc. (HMF), raised claims for damages pursuant to a Bareboat charter agreement for five vessels, including the M/V LELA FRANCO, for unpaid hire and expenses.  The complaint alleges that, contrary to representations in the complaint, HMF failed to properly maintain and repair the vessels, return the Tugs in the proper condition, pay for necessary repairs, and continue charter hire accruing until the vessels were brought into the condition required for their redelivery.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $41,184.84 plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $55,305.59.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.   The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act, Section 13(b)(2)(A) and Rule 13b2-3 thereunder and Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13b-11, and (4) in person and in person against HMF for recovery of repossession expenses following breach of five Bareboat Charters (including the L&A FRanCO's).  The Complaint also alleges that Tug and HMF violated Section 15(a) of The Exchange Act and Rule 15a-4 thereunder by failing to adequately disclose certain of the issues raised in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint.gov\u00c2\u00a0"
