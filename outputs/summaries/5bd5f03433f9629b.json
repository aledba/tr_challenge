  "summary": "On June 7, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of bribing two U.N. officials in violation of the anti-bribery provisions of the federal bribery laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, from 2009 to 2015, Francis Lorenzo, a Dominican Republic citizen serving as the country\u2019s Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations, and John Ashe, a United States citizen who was President of the General Assembly at the time, engaged in a sustained effort over five years to bribe the two officials.  According to the complaint, the defendants knew that Ng was corruptly giving anything of value in exchange for a bribe, and that the bribe was not a legitimate act.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants did not have sufficient understanding of the quid pro quo provisions of \u00a7 666 to determine whether they were violating the federal law.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Ng consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a $302,977 civil penalty.  On August 5, 2019, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Ng and ordered him to surrender his passport and other documents related to the alleged bribery.  As part of the settlement, Ng also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public organization for five years and to a five-year officer-and-director bar.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-2765 (January 24, 2019).  The complaint also seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) and Rule 13b2-3 thereunder and a penalty from the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia for the amount of $2,500, $6,500 and $1,500 that each defendant will pay in connection with any federal program or organization that receives federal funding.  Finally, the SEC is seeking a preliminary injunction against further violations of Sections 13(a), 13(c), and 17(a)(3) and (4) and a penny stock bar against Ng, as well as a $1 million civil penalty against each of the defendants.
