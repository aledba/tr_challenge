  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment in favor of First Mercury Insurance Company, Inc., a Chicago-based insurance company, against three other defendants for malicious prosecution arising out of a 1982 double murder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, Alstory Ciolino, an investigative reporter for the Chicago office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Jack P. Rimland, an attorney for First Mercury, falsely claimed that First Mercury would provide insurance coverage against claims of malicious prosecution when, in fact, First Mercury did not provide coverage at all.  The complaint further alleges that, as a direct result of the defendants' conduct, the defendants did not owe coverage to First Mercury.  First Mercury agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins First Mercury from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders First Mercury to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the Illinois Attorney General's Office today announced that it would re-evaluate its 2014-15 insurance policy, and First Mercury has agreed to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount of its pre-judgment interest in the case.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Division of Insurance Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Andrew B. Hannan.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221."
