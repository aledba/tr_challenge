  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against a Pennsylvania man for failing to register as a sex offender.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that Daniel C. Appellant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC alleges that Appellants violated the registration and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, and that his failure to register constituted an ex post facto violation of the SEC's pre-announcement registration requirements. The complaint further alleges that, in addition to failing to comply with the SEC registration requirements, Appelant was also charged with violating the mandatory reporting requirements of Section 3806 of the Criminal Justice Act of 1940, and was subsequently sentenced to 18 months of imprisonment followed by five years of supervised release.  According to the complaint, in violation of these provisions, Appelleant committed statutory sexual assault on three occasions in 2012, with the final incident occurring near the end of August of that year.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Appelland consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the federal and state registration provisions, and orders him to submit to an evaluation by the Sexual Offender Registration and Notification Board (SORNA) that will determine whether he is a sufficient risk to be subject to the mandatory registration provisions of SORNA. The court also issued a temporary restraining order halting the application of the registration provisions.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office today announced that it has filed an emergency action to halt the alleged violations of the anti-fraud provisions. The investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. McGarry. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
