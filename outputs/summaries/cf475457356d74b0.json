  "summary": "On April 24, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered final judgments in favor of ILA Local 21 and International Longshoremen's Association #1316 in a civil injunctive action brought by the District Attorney's Office.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges that defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, contrary to the SEC's findings, defendants continued coming to the union halls and offices to intimidate and harass Plaintiff and to impose punitive damages against her.  According to the complaint, the jury found that neither defendant was liable under the federal securities laws for engaging in a conduct that constituted a hostile work environment.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants' conduct was not consistent with the conduct described in the complaint.  As a result of these findings, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  On June 2, 2015, the Honorable Judge Robert J. Bentsen of the New York District Court entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the anti-harassment provisions of the federal law and orders them to pay $5,400 in lost wages and $100,000 in punitive damages, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties of $200,000 and $250,000, respectively.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating these provisions, and from participating in or participating in any future conduct that constitutes a violation of the employer-employer bar. The settlements are subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Aug. 5, 2013).  The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.
