  "summary": "On January 8, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered final judgments against Entertainment Partners, L.L.C. and its insurance company, AIG, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Ms. Brown was employed by Entertainment Partners and was injured in a work-related accident on August 31, 2015.  According to the complaint, Brown suffered from back pain, anxiety, and depression prior to the accident, and she did not report any increased back pain or a back injury until well after the accident.  In addition to her back pain and anxiety, the complaint also alleges that her right knee injury occurred in 2011 when she fell out of a van on another movie set and injured her right leg.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Brown was not injured in the accident and was not required to have surgery on her injured knee.  However, the SEC alleges that Dr. Todd and Dr. Shamieh recommended she have back surgery at L4-5-S1, which is a different location than where she had previously had surgery on that injury.  Based on the evidence presented, the court found that Brown did not have any issues with her lower back or lower back pain prior to this accident and she settled her claims for indemnity and medical benefits, attorney fees, and penalties in July of 2019.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Brown consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and requires her to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval.
