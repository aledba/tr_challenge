  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of a series of felony charges.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, alleges that, from at least 2014 through at least 2015, Tyler B. Moore, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for orchestrating a string of high-level drug-related criminal activity, made numerous false statements to the jury, and failed to disclose that Moore was a member of a criminal street gang. Moore also allegedly told the jury that the decedent had broken into houses and taken guns, and that he had been in previous physical altercations with the defendant. The complaint alleges that Moore knew Moore had a history of violence and that Moore had been a violent criminal. Moore agreed with the SEC's findings, and Moore agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. Moore consented to the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The court also agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Section 13(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 and Rule 13a-3 thereunder. The judgment also prohibits Moore from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with a criminal case. Moore has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to a conduct-based injunction. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Texas, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice."
