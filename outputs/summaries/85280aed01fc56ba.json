  "summary": "The Nebraska Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing criminal case brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Nebraska against a Nebraska cattle rancher charged with obstructing a public road.  According to the SEC's complaint, John E. Thelen was charged in September 2016 with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 39-301 of the Nebraska Department of Transportation. The complaint alleges that, since 2013, Thelen repeatedly placed his fence in the County\u2019s ditch right-of-way and failed to remove it after being given reasonable notice to do so.  The complaint further alleges that he repeatedly sought permission to erect a fence on the same land in which he had previously been convicted of violating the state highway laws.  As alleged in the complaint, in August and October 2013, He placed a newly erected fence along the county road and in the county right of way, which Thelen had previously agreed to do.  In November 2014, Thel allegedly placed another fence in that same right-o-way, but this fence was removed in October or November 2016.  On September 13, 2016, the court granted Thelen a temporary restraining order and ordered him to remove the fence.  Last week, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Thelen, charging him with violations of the federal securities laws, and ordering him to pay $400,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by David E. Schmidt, Carla Schmidt, and David R. McAllister of the Salt Lake Regional Office, with assistance from Eric R. Werner of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Schmidt and supervised by Ms. Schmidt. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Nebraska Attorney General's Office, and the Nebraska Office of Inspector General in this matter."
