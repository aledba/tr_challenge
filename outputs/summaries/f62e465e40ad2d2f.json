  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against former Marine Corps officer Gary L. Jackson for his alleged violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, Jackson alleges that, following his discharge from the Marine Corps in 1977, his superiors allegedly retaliated against him for refusing to approve a warehouse inventory inspection in August 1988 and subsequently refusing to consider his request for a reenlistment.  Jackson also alleges that his superiors delayed for a short time, but eventually granted, Jackson's request to attend the Non-Commissioned Officer Academy.  The SEC alleges that Jackson filed a second complaint with the SEC in January 1991, alleging that he had become the target of \"retaliation and continual harassment\" as a result of his requests to speak to his commanding officer.  As alleged in the complaint, Jackson received numerous decorations, letters of appreciation, and commendations, including a Navy Achievement Award for his performance while serving in the warehouse inspection position, as well as a commendation for securing top secret documents discovered in a rental vehicle.  In addition, the complaint alleges that after his discharge, Jackson sought relief from various sources, including high-level officers in the Department of Justice, attorneys, congressmen, and new media, including members of Congress, members of congress, and members of the media, who allegedly failed to investigate Jackson's allegations.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Jackson has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 12(b)(1) and 13(a)(2) and orders him to pay disgorgement of $300,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $10,000.  On May 18, 1990, Jackson made a request through his chain of command for his reentry code to be upgraded from \u201c4\u201d to \u201c1.\u201d  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Jackson.  Among other things, the Attorney General's Office today announced that it has obtained an asset freeze against Jackson, ordering him to surrender his passport, and ordering the appointment of a receiver to facilitate his repatriation.  Finally, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Jackson on June 22, 2016, against whom it obtained a temporary restraining order, an officer-and-director bar, and an officer and director bar.  This action is subject to court approval. "
