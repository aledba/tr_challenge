  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment in favor of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) in a blood alcohol test case.  The court's order, which was entered on May 24, 2016, finds that FDLE has the authority to determine whether a blood sample is safe to take, and that FDle has the right to require blood analysts to check the accuracy of blood tests.  According to the order, FDLE and its predecessor agencies failed to comply with Rule 11D-8.012, which requires that blood analysts check for blood clotting in blood samples before they are collected.  FDLE also failed to require analysts to remove or mix blood from the sample before it is taken for testing.  In addition, the court found that the FDLE's method of blood collection did not meet the requirements for FDLE.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The court also granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of FDLE, and barring them from further violations of the federal securities laws. The SEC's order also prohibits FDLE from imposing any monetary penalty against the defendants, and requires FDLE to provide a copy of the final judgment to each of the parties in the case. The final judgment also prohibits the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") or the reporting provisions of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and (c) thereunder of Rule 12b2-1. The Court also ordered FDLE not to violate the reporting provision of Sections 12(a) and 13(c) of Securities Act and Section 15(a).  The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations of these provisions, as well as civil penalties against all defendants.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-11-01, Litigation Bulletin No. 13-cv, Liturgical Release No-13-01.  Litigation Alert No. 12-cv 13-01-11.  An SEC order appointing a receiver to oversee the collection and processing of blood samples is pending final approval by the court."
