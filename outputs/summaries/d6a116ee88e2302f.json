  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Alabama today announced criminal charges against a roofing contractor and its principal for failing to timely and timely respond to an order appointing an independent auditor to review the roofing industry.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Montgomery, Alabama, alleges that U. S. Ply, Inc. (\"US Ply\"), a company that manufactures and sells roofing products for residential and commercial buildings in Montgomery County, used RapidGRIP as the middle layer of a three-ply roofing system on two apartment buildings in 2013.  According to the complaint, the manufacturer misrepresented to the auditor that the product was self-adhering, high-tack, and that it would bond to the roof when it was installed.  In addition, the complaint alleges that when installing the roofs at Sunningdale, ARCI failed to properly store and install the roof material before it installed the roof.   The complaint further alleges that before ARCI decided to use the roof materials, it failed to provide the auditor with sufficient evidence to determine whether it had violated any of the agreed-upon warranties that apply to roofs.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Analysis and Detection Center, with the assistance of the Alabama Office of Inspections and Examinations, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The case has been supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Timothy M. Welshhans and supervised by Amy S. Cotter."
