  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and two entities associated with it in a workers' compensation insurance case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Monterey County, California, alleges that, in 2013 or early 2014, Jackpot Harvesting, Inc., a California-based insurance company, and two related entities failed to comply with the mandatory filing requirements for workers\u2019 compensation insurance contracts. Jackpot claimed that the arbitration agreement in the Request to Bind was invalid because it did not provide for arbitration, and Jackpot\u2019s challenge to the arbitration was unrelated to any other arbitration agreement that Jackpot had entered into.  According to the complaint, the Arrangement to Bind does not require arbitration, but rather requires that a court determine the enforceability of the arbitration.  Jackpot also alleged that, as a result of the litigation, it was unable to obtain a court order to compel arbitration based on its claims.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, however, the defendants agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Jackpot.  On February 5, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendants, charging them with violations of the federal securities laws, and with violating the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933. The SEC also charged Jackpot with violating Section 11658 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 12b2-1 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and penny stock bars against all defendants, as well as an officer-and-director bar against each of the defendants. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the SEC's Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Graham Loomis. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
