  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment in favor of a taxi cab company and its owner in a civil action arising out of an alleged sexual assault.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kentucky, alleges that, in 2010, Andria Kendall was raped and sexually assaulted by Mohamud Abukar, a taxi driver for Community Cab, Inc. (\u201cCommunity Cab\u201d). According to the complaint, despite having no criminal history or record, the cab driver allegedly breached his duty to exercise ordinary care in the selection of his employees. The complaint further alleges that Godbey and his law firm failed to adequately investigate the background of the taxi driver and failed to file a timely law suit against the cab company. The SEC also alleges that the taxi company failed to properly vet the driver because he had a clean criminal record, and therefore, he was not liable for legal malpractice.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Godbey.  On February 15, 2016, the trial court granted summary judgment against Community Cab. The court held that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the jury was entitled to a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating these provisions. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (Feb. 16, 2016).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson under the supervision of Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kentucky Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
