  "summary": "On June 20, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Helms Realty Corp., a New York-based real estate agent, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that Helms violated Section 4 of the New York State Securities and Exchange Commission (\"Securities Act\") for unlawfully advertising the use of a class A multiple dwelling for non-permanent residence purposes.  According to the complaint, Helms also violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 5(d) of Securities Exchange Rules 5(b)(2) and (3) thereunder, and Helms has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against the two individuals charged in connection with the alleged violations of Section 4(a).  The complaint also charges Helms with violating Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 5b2-1 and Rule 15a-3 thereunder and Section 17(a)(2)(A) of The Securities Act of 1933.  It seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of the securities laws, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 598-98, July 11, 2017.  On August 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order requiring Helms to comply with Exchange Act Rules 5a-14, 13a-1, and 17a-11 thereunder against him.  A hearing officer has also been appointed by the SEC to determine whether to issue an order imposing a preliminary injunction, imposing a civil penalty, and appointing a receiver to oversee the enforcement of the proposed injunction.  An SEC hearing on August 16, 2017 was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter, including the Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Conduct Authority. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor"
