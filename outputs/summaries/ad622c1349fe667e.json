  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment in favor of the bankruptcy court's motion to compel the turnover of estate property in the underlying bankruptcy case, In re Copeland 2:14-bk-10119-MCW.  According to the court's order, filed on June 30, 2014, in the case of Duan C. Copeland, who was in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, he and his wife, Lily E.Copeland, purchased a 2008 Nissan Rogue, a 2007 Porsche Cayman, and a 2010 Kawaski Z-1000 motorcycle.  The court found that the vehicles were not part of the Chapter 7 estate when they were in Chapter 11, and therefore did not qualify as part of a post-petition personal service income when they converted from Chapter 7 to Chapter 7.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Copeland and Copeland consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of $100,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and to pay civil penalties of $20,000 and $10,500, respectively.  Appellees also agreed to be enjoined from future violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Copeland.   The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Arizona, charges Copeland with violating Section 5 and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations and a return of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  To learn more about bankruptcy law violations, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5, No. 527 B.R. at *4 (Bankr. W.D.N.Y. 2016).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Asset Management Unit, under the supervision of Joseph G. Sansone."
