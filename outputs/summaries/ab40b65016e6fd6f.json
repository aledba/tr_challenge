  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment against a New Haven man who was convicted of two counts of robbery in the first degree in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Haven, Connecticut, alleges that, on July 31, 2012, Ruben Gonzalez and Jose Rivera were robbed at gunpoint while working together during the night shift at a warehouse in Newington, Connecticut. According to the complaint, the defendant and his accomplice, Ernest Harris, entered the car at approximately 3:30 a.m. and began rolling a blunt of marijuana for Gonzalez. The complaint alleges that the defendant immediately identified the accomplice as the passenger side assailant, who had been riding bicycles in the area at the time of the robbery. As alleged, however, Rivera had not observed the defendant or Harris before the robbery and had not yet observed the assailant. Instead, the complaint alleges, he immediately recognized the defendant's beard, which he described as a \"Rick Ross\" type beard, and that Harris had taken the marijuana from the car. The SEC further alleges that after the defendants left the scene, Rivera confronted them and asked them where the drugs and money were, and they told him that he had \"ample time\" to observe the defendant. The defendant and Harris then entered the vehicle and drove away, leaving the victims to fend for themselves. The court found that, despite Rivera's efforts to suppress the evidence, he could not corroborate the reliability of his identification with the evidence presented at the trial.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against both defendants.  On August 13, 2019, the Honorable Judge Robert F. McCole granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against the defendants, ordering the SEC to conduct a parallel criminal investigation. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations, and Joseph G. Sansone, Regional Director of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Office of the Attorney General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Connecticut Department of Banking and Securities."
