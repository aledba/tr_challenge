  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Montana today entered a final judgment in favor of Homes For Our Troops, a Montana-based nonprofit corporation that builds custom homes throughout the country and donates them to disabled veterans.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, in October 2013, the District Court entered an order ordering Homes for our Troops to pay $115,929.80 in attorney fees to TCH Builders and Remodeling, Inc., a Montana construction company owned and operated by Phil Thelen, for a $342,000 lien foreclosure.  According to the complaint, TCH's attorney, Del Post, was not party to the contract between EOC and TCH, which included a clause providing for a \"reasonable\" amount of attorney fees.  Instead, the complaint alleges that TCH was entitled to an attorney fee based on the amount of fees incurred in litigating the lien claims against EOC.  In its complaint, which was filed in the district court, the court found that all of the attorney fees incurred by TCH were reasonable, and that the amount owed to the Lien Claimant was within the reasonable amount of the fees incurred.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's order, Homes for OUR Troops consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $120,981.05, which is equal to the amount TCH has to pay in its default judgment.  Additionally, the judgment orders TCH to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties of $1.838 million, which will be determined by the court at a later date.   The court also issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of TCH and imposing a $100,000 civil penalty against Thelen. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Andrew P. Wohl and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry in the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Mississippi Office of Financial Regulation in this matter."
