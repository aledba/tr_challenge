  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Connecticut today announced criminal charges against a Connecticut-based company for failing to establish an independent business relationship with its sales representatives.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that, under the federal securities laws, certain individuals engaged in door-to-door sales of vacuums provided by the company, Kirby of Norwich, Inc., were not required to establish that the individual was engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business of the same nature as that involved in the service performed by the putative employee. In addition, the complaint alleges that the company's sales representatives, Bryant Gardner, and Vess Zaprianov, were not engaged in the independent business activity required by part C of the ABC test, and were liable to make contributions to the fund.  According to the complaint, the defendants' sales representatives did not perform any independent work, and, in fact, did not engage in any independent business at all. The complaint further alleges that none of the sales representatives engaged in that independent work were employees of the company.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against the defendants, finding that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000, which will be deemed satisfied by the court at a later date.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, Kirby consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $15,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Robert C. Leuba of the U. S. District Court in Connecticut granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the company to comply with the court's order. The court granted the request for an injunction and ordered that the SEC conduct an independent examination of the companies involved in this matter. The SEC is continuing its investigation. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Employment and Training. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Hendel."
