  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a former state senator and his wife in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that Adelbert Burdge III (Burdge) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its order, the court found that the former senator and former senator had violated Section 15(e) of Exchange Act Section 10 and Rule 15e-1 thereunder, and that he had violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers of the Fund\").  The court also found that Butch violated Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Securities Act Sections 10 and 13 of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b-11 thereunder and that the court had improperly appointed Butch as guardian of Lillian's person and estate.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Butch consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $140,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Anette and Tena agreed to settle the case by consenting to entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the charged sections, and order them to pay civil penalties of $150,000 each.  On May 12, 2017, the Honorable Amy C. Welshhans of the Chicago Regional Office issued an order appointing a plenary guardian for Lillian. The order also requires Butch to provide a copy of the letter of the order to the court, which is subject to court approval. The court granted the request for a temporary restraining order against Butch, and ordered him to provide an accounting of the amount of money that Lillian had received as a result of a medical malpractice claim, and to provide for the appointment of a temporary guardian. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Burdges III. The SEC also announced that it had obtained an emergency court order freezing the assets of the two former senatorial candidates and appointing a receiver of the deceased senator's estate. The Court granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze and an accounting against the other candidates."
