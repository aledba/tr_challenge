  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Jeanette Janusiak, a Wisconsin resident who was convicted of first-degree intentional homicide for her role in the death of a friend\u2019s baby.  The court found that, contrary to the majority of the evidence presented to the court by the court, the officers violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder. The court also found that the officers did not unreasonably apply the antiterrorism and effective death penalty provisions of \u00a7 2254(d) and that the defendants were not liable for the officers\u2019 actions.  According to the Court, Janusak, who was eight months pregnant at the time of her arrest, initially told the officers that she would not go to jail if she did not cooperate with the officers, but later admitted that she had lied to the officers about the nature of the injuries and the severity of her injuries.  She also allegedly told one of the officers: \u201cI would rather go home to my children than risk losing my job.\u201d  The Court also ruled that, in violation of Section 2254, the officer-in-charge privilege against self-incrimination, that she was not required to give a reasonable explanation for her actions in the course of the interrogation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, Januskak consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a penalty equal to the amount of her ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Wisconsin today announced criminal charges against Januska.
