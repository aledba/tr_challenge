  "summary": "On July 19, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York entered a final judgment against Algonquin Gas Transmission, LLC, a New York-based energy company, for failing to adequately consider the cumulative environmental impacts of its three pipeline upgrades.  The court found that the Commission improperly segmented its environmental impact analysis for the three projects and failed to consider the safety concerns of a third-party contractor.  According to the court's order, the Commission failed to adequately evaluate the cumulative impacts of the three upgrades, which included a provision requiring the contractor to provide a \"hard look\" at the project's potential impact on the environment.  In its final judgment, the court also ordered the company to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the company consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest thereon, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively. The court also granted the company's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits it from issuing or selling any oil, gas, or coal-based securities, and from participating in any future regulatory proceeding.  On August 21, 2017, the Court granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 7 of the federal securities laws, and ordered the entity to submit a final environmental impact statement by September 30, 2018.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Enforcement's Risk Analysis and Detection Center. The litigation will be led by Norman Bay and supervised by Amy Gwiazda. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office, and the Massachusetts Department of Natural Resources."
