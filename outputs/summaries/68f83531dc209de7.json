  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment in favor of the Village of Buffalo Grove in a related administrative proceeding.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Buffalo Grove, Illinois, on March 23, 2018, the Board of Trustees of the Buffalo Grove Firefighters' Pension Fund found that, in May 2014, Hauber was diagnosed with colon cancer.  The complaint alleges that the Board improperly classified Hauber's cancer as a \"permanent disabling condition\" and failed to consider whether he qualified for a duty disability pension based on his work as a firefighter or paramedic.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that, while Hauber responded to at least 127 fire calls, he did not receive a duty pension because he was not physically or mentally able to perform the job.  Hauber also had a history of colon cancer, which, according to the complaint, was caused by exposure to carcinogenic, poisonous, or chemical gases from firefighting.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's opinion, the pension fund has agreed to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil monetary penalty, and a bar against Hauber from serving as an officer or director of a public company.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5/4-110(i) (January 27, 2019).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael D. Kuznetsova and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Department of Insurance, and the Illinois State Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
