  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against two insurance companies for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that in September 2011, USAT filed suit in Guilford County Superior Court against International Legwear Group, Inc., a company conducting business within North Carolina.  According to the complaint, the company had failed to disclose its worsening financial condition, while continuing to obtain products from USAT upon credit.  USAT also alleged that Navigators Insurance Company and Navigators Management Company, Inc. did not have standing to defend USAT for the claims brought in the complaint.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the company failed to inform the injured driver of the potential fire hazard created by water damage to the electrical system.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $1,993,856.48, prejudgment interest of $2,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.   The court also granted the defendants a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from acting as an unregistered broker-dealer or third-party beneficiary of the policies, and ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 each. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for North Carolina and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
