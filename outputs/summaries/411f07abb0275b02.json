  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two former attorneys who were charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that David M. Molner and Susan S. Tregub violated the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws by improperly obtaining confidential information from a former attorney while preparing to file a complaint against Molner for breach of fiduciary duty.  According to the complaint, Molner's former attorney, Susan A. Bergstein, provided confidential information to Molner to help him draft a master strategy memorandum, identify potential creditors, and file an emergency bankruptcy petition.  Bergstein agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  Molner also agreed to pay $150,222.64 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced parallel criminal charges against the defendants.  On March 24, 2010, a federal district court in San Diego entered a temporary restraining order and ordered Molner, Bergstein and others to comply with the court's order.  Last week, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions, an officer-and-director bar, and an officer and director bar.  To settle the SEC's action, defendants will be required to show cause and effect a determination by the court upon motion of the court on the merits of the case.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221.  Separately, the Department of Justice issued an order suspending Molner from appearing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering Bergstein to cooperate with the SEC in its investigation of alleged insider trading in the securities industry.  A hearing for the SEC today was scheduled for March 26, 2010. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
