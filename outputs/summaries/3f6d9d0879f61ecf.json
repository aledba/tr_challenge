  "summary": "On April 4, 2017, the Honorable Gerald Neuwirth of the U.S. District Court for the District of Oklahoma granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Oklahoma City, alleges that Frank C. Appellant, a convicted felon who was previously sentenced to 10 years and 10 months in prison for his role in the 2015 death of Donald Brewer, a Lawton, Oklahoma man who was shot and killed in a motel room on December 3, 2015.  According to the complaint, the defendant, who was not a felon, brandished a.32 caliber revolver and then shot Brewer several times, including several times in the face and torso.  As alleged, the gun was operable, and the pistol had an empty shell.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint filed in the federal district court for the district of Oklahoma, the Court of Criminal Appeals issued an order granting the SEC and other emergency relief, including a temporary asset freeze, and a temporary officer-and-director bar.  On May 9, 2018, the court granted the court's order granting relief to Appellants and ordered him to pay $4,966.50 to the Crime Victim's Compensation Fund, which is intended to be used to pay for the victims' medical bills and to provide for the emergency relief of the victims and their families.   The court also granted the defendants the right to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $5,000.  Additionally, the order granted relief to the defendant requires the court to consider the merits of the case before it is decided whether to issue a final judgment imposing a permanent injunction, imposing a civil penalty, and appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 17, 2018).  The complaint also seeks disgorgement with prejudgment interest and a civil monetary penalty, as well as the return of the defendant's allegedly unregistered and unregistered securities.  Finally, the SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Oklahoma Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, the Criminal Division, the Oklahoma State Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice Criminal Division Criminal Division's Office of Fraud and Detection, the Division of Criminal Investigations and the Office of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Market Abuse Unit's Analysis and Detection Center.  This case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson."
