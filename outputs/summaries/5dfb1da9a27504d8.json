  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Michael Ja'Rel Tutson, Jr., who was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 40 years at hard labor.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, on August 29, 2014, Tutson was outside a home peering into a window when the defendant ran after him. According to the complaint, the defendant then shot at the window, which was in the living room of the victim's mother and sister. The complaint further alleges that the defendant used his irrational decision making to create the illusion that he was trying to protect his family, to chase down the victim, and to make a \"gun battle\" between the victim and the defendant. The SEC alleges, however, that the trial judge arbitrarily limited the mitigating factors and failed to consider his lack of felony convictions as to whether he acted in self-defense.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Tutson.  On March 6, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action charging Tutson with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, Mr. Tutson consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his life sentence. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see SEC Complaint Bulletin No. 17-771, July 10, 2013, and Litigation Release No. 13-491, July 13, 2013."
