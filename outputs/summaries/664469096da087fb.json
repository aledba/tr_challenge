  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts yesterday entered a final judgment against Ivan Lopez, the former supervisor of the United States General Services Administration (GSA), for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, alleges that Lopez violated the anti-discrimination provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of these federal statutes.  According to the complaint, Lopez was the first supervisor at the GSA to conduct performance reviews for a plaintiff based on her sex, age, and religion.  Paul alleges that, as a result of Lopez's conduct, she was subsequently subjected to an adverse employment action.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order suspending Lopez from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an expert on the subject of the Commission's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's order, Lopez consented to the entry of a final judgement that permanently enjoins him from violating the anti\u2013discrimination provisions and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, from participating in any type of conduct that constitutes a \"prejudgmental finding\" under the federal securities laws.  On the same day, the Commission issued its order suspending Paul from appearing, practicing, or practicing in the public company that she was a member of.  It also ordered her to sign a civil injunctive proceeding, which requires her to show that she has established a prima facie case of discrimination under the relevant federal statutes, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, which prohibits an employer from imposing a penalty based on a finding of a reasonable basis for discrimination.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (January 15, 2009).  The Commission's complaint charges Paul with violating Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Exchange Act and Rule 206(3) thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.   The complaint also seeks a temporary restraining order, an officer-and-director bar, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of the above-mentioned provisions of the federal laws, as well as an order requiring the Commission to conduct an independent examination of the conduct of its employees."
