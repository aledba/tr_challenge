  "summary": "On June 26, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Khepera Charter School and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, alleges that, from 2014 to 2018, Plaintiff filed a civil injunctive action seeking a judgment that would impose a permanent injunction, impose a civil penalty, and require the defendants to pay disgorgement of $44,445, prejudgment interest, and pay civil penalties equal to the amount of their fees.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to comply with certain of the agreed-upon requirements of the agreement, including that each defendant pay a reasonable hourly rate in the event of a breach.  According to the complaint, as a result of this conduct, Plaintiff was unable to fulfill her obligations to the court, and thus was not entitled to the full amount of attorney's fees that she requested.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuers' issuers of the securities.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the basis of insufficient evidence to determine whether the defendants were liable for the full $97,987.50 in fees and $497.09 in costs.  On June 6, 2020, the District Court entered a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering Kheperas to pay a $160,000 civil penalty.  A hearing on the proposed settlement is scheduled for July 29, 2020.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2019 WL 598, at *3 (E.D. Pa. June 24, 2019).  The case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Philadelphia Regional Office, under the supervision of John R. Rymas. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Philadelphia Office of Education, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
