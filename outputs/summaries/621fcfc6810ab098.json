  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska today entered a final judgment against Lucinda D. Moore, a Nebraska woman who was charged with defrauding her husband out of more than $1 million in attorney fees.  According to the court's order, filed on February 21, 2018, Lucinda filed a complaint to reduce daycare expenses for her husband and three children, alleging that Lucinda was \"unwilling to co-parent\" with him and had been inflicting \"substantial mental abuse\" on their children.  The court also found that the amount of attorney fees incurred by Lucinda and Thayne was not reasonable and necessary.  As alleged in the complaint, the court ordered Lucinda to pay $1,394.35, $2,500 in child support, and $3,500 for attorney fees, when the parties had agreed that they would each pay their own expert's fees and expenses.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court\u2019s order, the ex-wife consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $'7,500.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Thayne.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Omaha, Nebraska, charges Lucinda with violating the anti-fraud provision of the federal child and dependent care tax credit and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Thayne has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to a permanent injunctive relief order, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to pay an officer and director bar.  On May 2, 2017, the Honorable Kathleen A. Bentsen of the Nebraska Court of Appeals issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order and appointing an independent receiver to determine whether to issue an order permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the law.  A hearing scheduled for June 19, 2018 will be conducted to determine the appropriate amount of restitution to be paid by the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17 (Feb. 21, 2017).  The Commission of Inquiry's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the\u00c2\u00c2"
