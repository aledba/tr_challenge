  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of West Virginia today announced criminal charges against a West Virginia-based mining company and its president and chief executive officer.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in West Virginia, alleges that Murray Energy Corporation and its CEO, Robert Murray, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 105(c)(1) of the federal mining laws.  According to the complaint, Murray and his company, Murray Energy Corp., raised the issue of interference in a series of mandatory \"Awareness Meetings\" that were held at the mines. The complaint alleges that, in these meetings, Murray criticized miners' use of the Section 103(g) process and instructed miners to report security breaches to management. Murray also allegedly encouraged miners to make the same \"prepared and approved\" statement to management as they did at the Awareness Meetings.  In a parallel action, the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) filed a complaint in federal district court against Murray Energy, alleging that Murray and Murray Energy violated Section 105. The SEC also charged Murray with violating Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  The complaint also alleged that Murray violated Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15a-1 and Rule 15b2-2 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Murray has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 105, and orders him to pay $20,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $30,000.  Murray has also agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from violating the federal securities laws and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 2, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Murray, ordering Murray to comply with the SEC\u2019s order, and ordering him to sign a cease-and-desist order.  A hearing scheduled for June 5, 2019 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (January 24, 2019).  The Commission appreciates the assistance of the UMWA, the UAWA, and the United States Postal Inspection Service in this matter."
