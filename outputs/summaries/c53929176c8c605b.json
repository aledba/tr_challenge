  "summary": "On May 14, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against 2K Games Inc. and Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (\"Take-Two\") for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Columbus, Ohio, James Hayden, a registered tattoo artist and lifelong resident of Northeastern Ohio, created original tattoos for some of the most recognized basketball players in the world.  The complaint alleges that Hayden obtained copyright registrations for six tattoos inked on NBA 2K players LeBron James, Shaquille O'Neal, Kyrie Irving, Danny Green, Dion Waiters, Mo Williams and Tristan Thompson.  As alleged in the complaint, these tattoos were not registered with the Copyright Office, and they are not subject to the preemption provisions of the federal securities laws.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that, with respect to his Unregistered Tattoos, Hayden has failed to demonstrate to the court that each of these tattoos constitutes a separate and distinct act of copyright infringement.  For example, as set forth in the Complaint, each tattoo represents a different expression of an idea, which is the essence of the \"case or controversy\" within the scope of the copyright.   The SEC's Complaint also alleges that    Take-2 has not asserted its copyrights against Hayden, and that Hayden has been injured because of his use of those tattoos.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint\u00c2\u00a02, Hayden consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) and (e)\u00c2\u00a0of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rules 5a-5, 5c-8, and 13d-1 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  Finally, the court granted the SEC &rsqua;s request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against Hayden from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, including securities in exchange for a share of a penny, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  This settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about preemption of state law claims, see"
