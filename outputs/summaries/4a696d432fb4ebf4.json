  "summary": "On August 17, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama entered a final judgment in favor of Hadi Store, LLC, a Tuscaloosa, Ala.-based liquor company, against the city of Tuscalaosa for denying Hadi's application for a liquor license.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Birmingham, Alabama, Hadi alleges that the city violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint further alleges that Hadi failed to provide sufficient evidence to support the city's decision to deny the liquor license to Hadi.  In a parallel action, the Alabama Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Hadi in connection with the same conduct that led the city to deny Hadi a license to sell liquor at a certain location in an area of the city known as the \"West End.\"  The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action in federal court against the company, charging Hadi with violating Section 17(a)(1) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") as well as Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  In its complaint, the SEC also charged the company with violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of Exchange Act Rule 206(3) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-3 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting the company's violations of Sections 206 (1) and 206 (2) and (4)-8 of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC case, the company consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties.  Hadi also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or promotion of any liquor license in the United States.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see SEC Litigation Release No. 17-cv-0117 (Aug. 18, 2018).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Alabama Division of Securities and Exchange Commission.  \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Alabama Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
