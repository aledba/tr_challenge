  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of a California-based company that has agreed to settle a civil injunctive action brought by a former employee who alleges that it violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sacramento, alleges that John Doe, who was assigned to work as a psychologist at Ironwood State Prison, submitted an accommodation request to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) in August 2007. According to the complaint, Doe's request for an accommodation was denied because he had asthma and dyslexia. The complaint further alleges that Dr. Castro had agreed to switch desks so Doe could have the opportunity to use the space he found less distracting. The SEC alleges that Doe refused to sign the accommodation request because he was \"too tired to do his job.\" The complaint also alleges that, when confronted by a CDCR employee who questioned Doe about his work performance, Doe replied, \"I'm tired of hearing about it. I'm just tired of trying to do my job.\"  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Doe consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $160,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a related administrative proceeding, the SEC instituted a hearing on the merits of the case. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
