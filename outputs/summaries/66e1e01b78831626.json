  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a former Juvenile Hall supervisor for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kern County, California, alleges that, while employed as a juvenile hall supervisor, George Anderson, made sexual comments to her, groomed her for sexual abuse, and looked at her inappropriately while she was showering.  According to the complaint, Anderson told her that he had a \"big butt\" in the shower and told her she should leave her boyfriend behind to find someone better like him.  Anderson allegedly also allegedly observed a female corrections officer watching a pretrial detainee in the bathroom and shower.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Anderson.  On May 24, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the District of San Diego entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Anderson from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078.71, and imposes a civil penalty of $10,000, and orders Anderson to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Anderson consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing a $50,000 penalty. The court also ordered Anderson to comply with the entry-of-the-judgment order.  To settle the case, Anderson agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from violating these provisions, and ordered to pay $1.8 million in restitution.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public institution for five years, and to be restrained from participating in any conduct that constitutes a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment right to bodily integrity.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2017.  Sepulveda v. Vazquez, 2017, No. 17-cv-01221 (9th Cir. 2004).  The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Corrections, and the Arizona Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
