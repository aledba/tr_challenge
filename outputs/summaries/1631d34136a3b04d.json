  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found unfit to stand trial on a charge of involuntary administration of psychotropic medication.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on July 23, 2015, Nageswararao Vallabhaneni, a clinical trial psychiatrist at Chester Mental Health Center in Randolph County, Virginia, was ordered to perform periodic blood draws and tests to monitor the medication, electrolyte, and enzyme levels.  The complaint alleges that, while in jail for the most recent aggravated battery charge, the respondent refused medication and was placed in isolation after he threatened to physically harm inmates and staff members.  As alleged in the complaint, the court's order required the respondent to provide clear and convincing evidence that the tests and procedures were essential for the safe and effective administration of the psychotropic medications.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, however, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public health organization.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Virginia today announced criminal charges against Vallabaneni.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David S. Kelly, John R. Rymas, and Steven T. Voorhees of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Kelly and Ms. Kelly. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Virginia Department of Health and Human Services, the Virginia State Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Virginia Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
