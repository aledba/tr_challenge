  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against Miguel A. Sagal, Jr., who was convicted of six felony counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that Sagal violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Sagal initially claimed that counsel had advised him to waive his right to a jury trial because he had no experience with the criminal justice system and that he would be able to participate in the selection of a jury.  In reality, the complaint alleges, counsel had failed to fully inform Sagal of the rights he was waiving and did not adequately investigate the two potentially exonerating witnesses or move for a new trial.  Sagal also allegedly failed to disclose to counsel that he had had sex with M.P., who also had lied to him about having sex with Sagal.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court in Utah on May 24, 2012, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Sagal from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains with respect to his prior convictions. The court also ordered Sagal to pay a $10,000 civil penalty, a $20,000 officer-and-director bar, and an $8,500 officer and director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Division of Criminal Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Utah Office of the Attorney General in this matter."
