  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the City of Buffalo in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that, on December 5, 2004, Anthony Turturro, then 12 years old, was hit by a car while attempting to cross Gerritsen Avenue in Brooklyn.  According to the complaint, the car was driven by Louis Pascarella, a New York City resident who was also injured.  As alleged, the complaint alleges that the city failed to conduct a traffic calming study before Anthony's accident and failed to follow up to determine whether there was a reasonable basis for the safety of the roadways.  In addition, the SEC alleges that in the course of its investigation, the City failed to adequately study the safety and cause of the accident.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the city consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Advisers\") and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder and ordering the city to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Finally, the court granted the city's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits it from issuing or selling any security-related documents, and from imposing a penny stock bar against the company or its officers and directors.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Donnelly of the United States District Court in Brooklyn entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the city from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1.5 million.   The court also granted the City's motion for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Birkenheier and Glenn S. Gordon of the New York Regional Office, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
