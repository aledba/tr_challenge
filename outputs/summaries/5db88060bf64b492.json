  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Sawyer Point Realty, LLC (\"Sawyer Point\"), a real estate development company, and its principal, David Braun, for violating the federal securities laws.  According to the court's order, in 1999, Sawyer Point added a second addition to its house in violation of the town's zoning ordinance.  The court found that the second addition was within the setback, and that the ZBA's decision to grant the equitable waiver was unreasonable.  In its order, the court also found that, for purposes of determining whether the property owner was entitled to a waiver based on the specific zoning violation, it had to make written findings to show that the violation was reasonable.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of their respective monetary penalties.  Finally, the Court granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from imposing any monetary penalty or imposing a civil penalty, and granted them the right to reapply for a building permit in the future. The court also granted the parties' motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and ordered the resumption of proceedings against the defendants. The Court also ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amounts of $1,000 and $2,500, respectively. The defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to the issuance of an equitable waiver. The settlement is subject to court approval. The litigation will be led by David F. and Katherine W. Dietz. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
