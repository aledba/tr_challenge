  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Reginald Carroll, Jr., a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania man who was charged with orchestrating a multi-million dollar bank robbery.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Carroll, who was also charged in the same criminal case.  According to the court's order, filed on December 6, 2018, Carroll was arrested on October 29, 2016, in connection with a bank robbery at the 2900 block of North Howard Street in Philadelphia. The court found that Carroll had reasonable suspicion that a man with the nickname of Fifty had been involved in the robbery, and that he had \"an idea who they were talking about.\" The court held that, based on the information provided to him, Appellant was likely the one who had committed the robbery and that the two men had taken his wallet and cell phone.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Carroll. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, charges Carroll with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Carroll consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000. The judgment also prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in any officer-or director-of-officer disciplinary proceeding. The Court also ordered Carroll to pay disgorgement of $36,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a $100,000 civil penalty for a total of $2,065, which includes a $20,000 officer-and-director bar. The order also prohibits Carroll from associating with anyone with a history of criminal activity, including his own criminal history, and from providing any assistance to law enforcement in the field of law enforcement matters.  On November 27, 2017, a bench trial jury convicted Carroll of two felony counts of securities fraud and sentenced him to four years to eight years in prison. The jury deliberated for two hours before finding Carroll guilty on all of the charges and ordering him to be enjoined from future securities law violations. On December 13, 2017 a jury found Carroll guilty of one felony count of aiding and abetting Carroll's violations of Section 17(a) of Securities Act Section 10b of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, and sentenced Carroll to five years of probation.
