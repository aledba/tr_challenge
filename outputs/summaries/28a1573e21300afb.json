  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alaska today entered a final judgment against a liquor license violator, finding that Fantasies on 5th Avenue, LLC violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Anchorage, Florida, the Board of Equalization (BOE) denied Fantasiness\u2019 license renewal in July 2016. The complaint alleges that the Board improperly denied the license renewal because it found that the club violated wage and hour laws, had no control over its finances or any of its bank accounts, and had no interest in renewing the license. The Board also found that, as a result of the Board\u2019s denial of the license, the club was not in the public interest, and that it had no incentive to renew the license at all. The SEC alleges that, in addition to the Board finding that the license was in violation of the above-mentioned provisions, the BOE also determined that, based on its findings, that the company violated the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws, that it was in the best interest of the public, that its dancers were not required to call 911 during apparent medical emergencies, that employees were not allowed to make 911 emergency calls, that a management agreement gave a direct financial interest in the license and that a manager had no right to use the facilities for dancing.  The complaint further alleges that a Board member temporarily halted the investigation until the next scheduled Board meeting to determine whether the Board violated due process.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the board has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $500,000. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the club. The investigation was conducted by Brian Stibitz and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Alaska Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
