  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against a Hampton, Va. resident for her role in a scheme to fraudulently obtain hydrocodone through fraud.  According to the SEC's complaint, Donna B. Talley worked for almost four decades at Dr. Steven Becker\u2019s solo dental practice in Hampton, Virginia. The complaint alleges that from 2002 to 2011, the practice regularly ordered approximately 26,700 pills of hydrocodione from Dr. Becker, Inc. and Darby Dental Supply, LLC, for a total of approximately 79,900 pills. As alleged in the complaint, Talley was unable to retain her court-appointed counsel because she had been unsuccessful in obtaining the right to counsel through fraud and mail fraud. The SEC alleges that in 2011, when the practice was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the court granted the SEC a temporary restraining order and ordered Talley to pay a $3,000 civil penalty.  The SEC also issued a show cause order suspending Talley from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of New York today announced criminal charges against Talley.  On May 24, 2017, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay civil penalties of $1,000 per month, and bars her from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from violating the charged provisions, ordering her to disgorge her ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and requiring her to make a civil monetary penalty of $2,500. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Virginia Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Virginia Office of Inspector General in this matter."
