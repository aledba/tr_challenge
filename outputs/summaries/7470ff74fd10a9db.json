  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a multi-faceted lawsuit alleging that the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services lacked diversity jurisdiction.  According to the court's order, Americold Realty Trust v. Conagra Foods, Inc., a Pennsylvania-based real estate investment trust, was filed in federal court for diversity jurisdiction based on the citizenship of the trust's trustees.  The court found that, in determining diversity jurisdiction, a trust trustee has to be a citizen of the same state as its trustee.  As alleged in the complaint, however, that citizenship of a traditional trust trustee is only that of its trustee, not that of the trustee. The court also found that a business trust trustee does not have the citizenship to determine whether a certain type of trust is a legitimate entity.  For example, the court previously held that a traditional trustee has a citizenship of one of its members.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice, the Office of Inspector General, today announced that it has issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct a diversity of citizenship investigation, including an examination of the citizenship and citizenship of certain of the trusts at issue. The SEC's order requires that the SEC's investigation be conducted by staff in the Division of Justice's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, and the case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov website\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and whether they have a history of practicing law."
