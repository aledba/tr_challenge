  "summary": "On May 10, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Dynamex Operations East, LLC (\"Dynamex\"), a delivery company now known as TF Final Mile LLC (\"TF Final Mile\").  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Wilmington, Massachusetts, Dynamx and SBS had entered into an agreement in January 2016, pursuant to which SBS was permitted to perform contract-and-driver services for Dynamax.  The complaint alleges that, as a condition of his employment, Ouadani was required to associate with a company that was not a signatory to an arbitration agreement, and that he performed the \"Contracted Services\" pursuant to the agreement.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the arbitration clause in the agreement does not apply to all of the parties to whom the arbitration is required.  For example, as alleged, in one instance, after passing his drug test, shadowing another delivery driver for a couple of days, receiving his Dynamex identification badge, and obtaining a cell phone and scanner set up with Google Express's software, he did not even know that the arbitration provision existed.  In another instance, in August 2016, after receiving a complaint from a driver who claimed that he was entitled to arbitration based on his work as a delivery driver, SBS agreed to pay $1.35 per hour, or seventy-two dollars for a four-hour shift.  SBS also agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest thereon, and to pay civil penalties thereon.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, D'Angelo has consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and imposing a $500,000 bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Massachusetts, and FINRA."
