  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma on June 25, 2008, entered a final judgment in favor of the Estate of Joshua Crittenden, finding that the officers violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1983 of the federal securities laws.  The court also granted summary judgment in the Estate's favor.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Oklahoma City on June 27, 2015, Officer Darren T. Tanner used excessive force when, pursuant to Tahlequah policy or custom, he fired a shot into the attic of a home.  As alleged in the complaint, after the shooting, the officers entered the attic and found a truck that had been reported stolen with ammunition in the bed and a loaded pistol in the cab.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from future violations of the securities laws, and from participating in any emergency response.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the officers.
