  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a California real estate broker who claimed that she was owed a commission for her efforts to sell a parcel of real estate in Marin County.  According to the SEC's complaint, on April 9, 2013, Bernice Jacobs signed a \"Vacant Land Listing Agreement\" (VLS) under which she was granted the exclusive and irrevocable right to sell the property from the date of the signing of the agreement until one year later, when Jacobs alleges that, at the time of signing the agreement, she did not have written proof of Locatelli\u2019s supposed agency or that he signed the agreement.  The complaint alleges that Jacobs did not sign the agreement on behalf of the other owners, and that, as a result of the VLS order, Jacobs was barred by the statute of frauds and by the parol evidence rule.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Jacobs.  On March 5, 2015, the court granted the owners\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order against Jacobs and ordered her to pay a civil penalty of $200,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Jacobs consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to disgorge her ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $100,000, respectively.  Jacobs also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in any offering of a real estate investment.   The settlement is subject to court approval, and the court will determine the amount of disgorgement and civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Florida, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the California Secretary of State's Office, the FBI, the Department of Justice, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and FINRA."
