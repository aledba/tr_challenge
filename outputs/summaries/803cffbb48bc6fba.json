  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against BNSF Railway, Inc. (\"BNSF\"), alleging that it wrongfully terminated a former employee because of his race.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, Morris was terminated on April 30, 2013, after he failed to disclose that he had been terminated because of a history of misconduct related to his employment.  The complaint alleges that Morris was not required to show that he was discriminated against because he was African American.  In fact, according to the complaint, Morris's testimony about his termination was inconsistent with the evidence presented at trial.  For example, Morris described losing his home and car in a single run of a key train, which he described as \"very hard\" because he had to rely on his friends and family for places to stay.  As the complaint further alleges, Morris failed to mention that one of the comparators had been evicted from his home as a result of the termination.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the court agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of $375,000, prejudgment interest of $137,450, and a civil penalty of $500,000.  On August 21, 2019, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Gershfeld of the Chicago Regional Office issued a temporary restraining order against Morris, ordering him to surrender his passport, and ordering the company to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  A hearing scheduled for September 5, 2019 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.
