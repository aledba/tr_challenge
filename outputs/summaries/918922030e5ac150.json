  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Kevin Berman, a former chief of the New York Police Department, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that Kevin Berman violated Section 4323 of the spousal support order by transferring his business, Berman & Ely, a private investigation and security firm, over to his current wife.  According to the complaint, the court found that Kevin had transferred the business in bad faith in order to avoid his support obligations and ordered him to pay $9,500 per month in support and $220,442 in business income.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Kevin.  On May 30, 2013, the trial court ruled that Kevin could not have continued to receive income from the business he had transferred to his wife upon retirement, and that the court could not impose a penalty on him for not complying with the court\u2019s order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Kevin has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to return to work, and imposes a civil penalty of $100,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Kevin has also agreed to be enjoined from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, penny stock dealer, municipal advisor, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  To settle the SEC's charges, Kevin agreed to pay a $20,000 civil penalty and to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, on the condition that he pay a penalty in the amount of $50,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0institutions to identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
