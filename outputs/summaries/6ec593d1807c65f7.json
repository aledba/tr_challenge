  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment in favor of a settlement that permanently enjoins defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders defendants to pay a fee equal to or greater than the amount recovered by their clients.  The court also issued an order requiring defendants to show cause why they should not be entitled to a fee-shifting penalty.  According to the court's order, the defendants agreed to settle without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint and to the imposition of a permanent injunction.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey announced criminal charges against one of the defendants.  On January 2, 2014, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against the other defendant.  As alleged in the complaint, defendants were not entitled to an additional forty-five percent contingent fee when, in fact, they were entitled to more than fifty percent of the total settlement figure.  A.W.'s mother, B.W., informed the school's administrators of the alleged harassment and intimidation, which allegedly continued on a daily basis without investigation or appropriate action by school administrators.  Despite the alert, the harassment allegedly continued.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Jersey, charges defendants with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Additionally, the complaint seeks an injunction against future violations of Section 17(b)(2)(A) of Securities Act Section 13(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder and an order to bar defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order.  Without admitting to these violations, defendants consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining them from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and from violating Sections 13(b), 13(c) and 13(d) of Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 and 13d-1 thereunder.  Defendants also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company or association with a company that does not offer or sell securities in public companies.  Finally, defendants agreed not to apply for an enhanced fee under Rule 1:21\u20137(c).  The settlement is subject to court approval. "
