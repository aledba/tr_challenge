  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon today entered a final judgment in favor of the parties in a civil action brought by the court against them for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Eugene, Oregon, on May 24, 2014, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the parties from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $11,567.  The court also ordered the parties to pay attorney fees in the amount of $23,904.00, which is the amount owed to the parties by their respective children, regardless of whether the children were attending school at the time of the judgment.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the parties.  On May 26, 2019, the federal district court in Portland, Oregon entered an order granting the parties a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering the payment of civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating these provisions, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties of $25,000 and $30,000, respectively, against each of them.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Eric R. Werner and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Oregon Department of Education, and the Umpqua Community College System."
