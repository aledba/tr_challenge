  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was sentenced to death for his role in a recent prison riot.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, alleges that Judge Robert R. Shaffer improperly relied on the testimony of a clinical and forensic psychologist to determine whether a defendant with intellectual disabilities was competent to stand trial for the death penalty.  According to the complaint, Dr. Ford's testimony was consistent with the opinion of the court, which found that Carroll had significant deficits in adaptive functioning and that he was not \"mentally retarded.\"  The complaint further alleges that, while performing his duties as a corrections officer, Carroll was extensively tested for mental-health issues and had reported to one of his family members that he had a learning disability in reading while in prison.  In addition, the court found that, as a result of this research, Carroll's adaptive functioning was \"below average\" and \"below-average\" when compared to other mentally retarded individuals.  As a result, the Court of Criminal Appeals issued its final judgment on May 4, 2012, ordering the imposition of a permanent injunction against Carroll from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Carroll consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to be restrained from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, including securities in exchange for a share of the proceeds of a federal criminal conviction.  On May 5, 2013, the SEC issued an order requiring the court to consider the merits of Carroll's case and determine whether it is appropriate to impose a capital-murder penalty on him based on the evidence presented in the court's order.
