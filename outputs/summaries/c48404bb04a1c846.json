  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a St. Tammany Parish man accused of orchestrating a $140,000 drug buy.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in New Orleans, on November 19, 2015, a Covington, Louisiana State Police trooper and confidential source arranged to meet defendant in order to purchase heroin and marijuana at a Sonic Drive-in in Mandeville. The complaint alleges that defendant and the confidential source spoke about text messages that they had sent to each other earlier in the day, and the recording was played for the jury during cross-examination.  The complaint further alleges that during the course of the investigation, defendant and Trp. Gilberti engaged in a hand-to-hand transaction for marijuana and heroin within the view of the trooper. The SEC alleges that the defendant replied that he could not make any more purchases because defendant was already incarcerated for an unrelated offense at the time the arrest warrant for the instant offenses was executed.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Louisiana today entered a judgment ordering a temporary restraining order against the defendant and ordering a preliminary injunction against further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 16(a)(2)(A) and 17(b)(5)(B)(3)(B) thereunder. The court also ordered the defendant to pay a $20,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 bar against the officer or Director of a Public Company.  On December 1, 2015 Trp., in response to the State's questions, revealed that the narcotics investigation stopped because defendant had been arrested for an additional unrelated offense and was incarcerated in the same jail where he was arrested.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, during cross examination, defendant replied, \"[s]peaking of jobs, I think we all know what Mr. Champagne's job is. And that's to try to walk his client out of the door.\"  The SEC complaint charges the defendant with violating Sections 5 and 5 of the federal securities laws, and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar."
