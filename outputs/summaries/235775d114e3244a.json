  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Marla Martins, a Florida resident, for violating three court orders and causing her wrongful death lawsuit to be dismissed with prejudice.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Martins refused to participate in the preparation of a joint pretrial stipulation for her daughter Briana's death.  The SEC alleges that Ms. Martins failed to comply with the court orders, failed to file her exhibit and witness lists, and made false and misleading statements in her motion for a trial continuance.  In addition, the complaint alleges that she failed to respond to RCCL's requests for an attorney's fee and nontaxable costs, despite repeated requests from the court to do so.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the SEC also alleges that Martins violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\"), and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 206(8), No. 207(1) and No. 208(2)-8(4).  The Court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order appointing a receiver to handle the litigation.  On January 4, 2019, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Sansone of the United States District Court in Miami issued an order suspending Martins from appearing or practicing before the court as a pro se litigator, ordering her to submit a written response to the court's order suspending her from appearing, practicing, or participating in the pre-judice proceedings of any court proceeding, and requiring her to sign an affidavit or declaration explaining why she did not comply with certain of the court order provisions of the Adviser Act.  A hearing on February 27, 2018, was scheduled for 5:30 p.m. and Judge Sansone agreed to the appointment of a receiver under Rule 206 of the Appellate Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (Bureau of Investigation) to determine whether to proceed with the litigation against Martins.
