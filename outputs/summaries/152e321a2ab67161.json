  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin today entered a final judgment against a former pediatrician retained by the defendants to offer expert testimony on the causes and causes of their neurocognitive injuries.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Madison, Wisconsin, alleges that Timothy R. Kelly, a licensed clinical trial physician retained by defendants, provided false testimony in support of his opinion that early childhood exposure to lead paint contributed to or increased plaintiffs' risk of developing neurotic illnesses.  Kelly also provided corroborating testimony that, contrary to Kelly's opinion, Kelly failed to consider the evidence presented by Kelly and others, including that the plaintiffs were not exposed to lead when they were, nor did Kelly and Kelly report that lead paint caused them to develop neurotic symptoms.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Kelly.  According to the SEC's Complaint Complaint, Kelly represented Kelly to the court, and Kelly agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Kelly from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Kelly to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. Kelly also agreed to be barred from appearing as an expert on the subject of the litigation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Kelly consented to entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering her to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 penalty. Kelly has agreed to a settlement where she will be permanently enjoined from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and to be subject to the appointment of a trial judge. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Welshhans granted Kelly's motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered Kelly to comply with the court's order.  A hearing for Kelly is scheduled for May 26, 2018. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Wisconsin Department of Health and Human Services, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter.
