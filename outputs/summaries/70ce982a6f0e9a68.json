  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Willemsen, a San Bernardino County real estate agent, and two other appraisers in a parallel action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Bernardino, California, alleges that on February 27, 2007, Willemen entered into a written contract to purchase 4.83 acres of vacant real estate from Avista Development, LLC.  According to the complaint, the appraisers knew he was the borrower and knew he would rely on the appraisal to determine the value of the property.  However, the complaint alleges that the appraiser did not consider the property as suitable for his purposes and instead relied on the valuation provided in the agreement.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the appraisal report was for the purpose of determining whether the property was suitable for the borrower's needs.  In addition, the Complaint alleges that, as a result of his misrepresentations to the court, he was left with a piece of property that was not suitable for him to use as collateral for a loan.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint and the SEC, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $1.6 million, prejudgment interest of $2.2 million, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Willemsens has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  Separately, the SEC announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Andrew P. Mitrosilis and Kraig S. Takacs, alleging that the defendants violated Section 5 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 5b2-1 thereunder and that they aided and abetted the violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 9(e) thereunder of the investment adviser and adviser registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  Additionally, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants in a related administrative proceeding on September 5, 2011, in which the court found that the court had improperly granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment based on the facts set forth in the complaint.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1763-1664 (January 30, 2011).  The Complaint also seeks a permanent injunction against future violations and a conduct-based injunction against"
