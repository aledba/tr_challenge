  "summary": "On March 17, 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment in favor of two Ukrainian men and their Ukrainian wives who were charged with orchestrating an international human trafficking ring.  According to the SEC's complaint, Yaroslav Churuk and Mykhaylo Botsvynyuk operated an international trafficking ring that recruited young Ukrainians to work for them with the promise of good paying jobs and a better life in the United States.  The complaint alleges that the defendants used extortion and threats of violence to keep the victims in line, and that one of the defendants threatened to stab his wife and daughter-in-law.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants also allegedly used extortion to keep them in line.  In a parallel action, on March 16, 2015, a federal district court in Brooklyn, N.Y., entered an order suspending the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of $288,272.28, prejudgment interest of $192,768, and a civil penalty of $160,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s order, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and order them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $320,000 each.   The defendants also agreed to be barred from serving as officers or directors of any SEC-registered broker-dealer, and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in connection with the alleged scheme.  Finally, the court granted the Defendants\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from making material misrepresentations about the nature of the alleged conspiracy, and ordered them to provide evidence to the court that corroborated the defendants\u2019 statements in the indictment.  Additionally, the Court granted the defendants the right to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest in the amounts of $150,000 and $250,000, respectively, to be distributed to the victims and their family members.  On March 24, 2019, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Brooklyn District Court issued an order temporarily suspending the Defendants from appearing or practicing before the court as part of the RICO conspiracy trial.  Sansone agreed to a five-year prison term and to pay a $150 million civil penalty."
