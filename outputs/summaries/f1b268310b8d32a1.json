  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois yesterday entered a final judgment against Nicholas Gouletas, a former manager of a limited liability company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15e-3 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, from at least 1997 through at least 2006, Goulettas and his company, River City Investors, LLC (RCC), improperly diverted a corporate opportunity to acquire a leasehold interest in the parking garage and commercial space at the River City Complex.  According to the complaint, as a result of this conduct, defendant could not engage in any business with RCC without violating the fiduciary duties of the company.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendant failed to disclose to RCC that he was in charge of the day-to-day operations of RCC and that he had no managerial authority over RCC.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains with respect to the other defendants in the same case.  On March 1, 2008, the court granted a motion for summary judgment in favor of Gouletta, RCC, and Carroll and Ernst for aiding and abetting defendant's violations of the charged sections of the securities laws, and granted a temporary restraining order and an order appointing a receiver to oversee RCC's compliance with the agreed-upon operating agreement.  As a result, Katris and RCC have agreed to settle the case against them.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Aug. 24, 2016).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Gouletsas.  This action is subject to court approval.  A hearing is scheduled for May 21, 2018.  To determine whether to proceed with the litigation, the SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling them investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an\u00c2\u00a0investor\u00c2\u00a0advisory\u00c2\u00a0registration\u00c2\u00a0on how to spot signs of misconduct in the securities industry\u00c2\u00a0that could be used to determine whether a defendant is liable for a penalty or a permanent injunction.
