  "summary": "On January 28, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment in favor of the parties in a civil injunctive action brought by the court against Colorado Technical University, Inc. and its parent company, Career Education Corporation, for its alleged prior practices with its students.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in Columbia, South Carolina on August 29, 2019, Booker T. Little, Jr. of Greenbelt, Maryland, alleges that, in the context of transactions involving sophisticated parties, the parties entered into a settlement agreement without admitting or denying any of their claims.  The court found that, under the terms of the settlement agreement, all of the defendants' claims were subject to arbitration.  In a parallel action, the Court of Appeals for the Western District of South Carolina issued an order requiring the parties to submit arbitration claims to an arbitrator based on their knowledge or experience with arbitration, without admitting to any violations of the federal securities laws, and without admitting that the parties had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Additionally, the court issued a temporary restraining order preventing the parties from acting as an unregistered broker-dealer in a transaction involving an unsophisticated individual.    The SEC's complaint charges the parties with violating Section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act and Rule 12(b)(6) thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On January 31, 2020 the court granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction, entered an order appointing an independent arbitrator, and appointed a receiver to determine the scope of the arbitration, which is subject to the jurisdiction of the court.  Without admitting to the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of these provisions, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000, $50,000 and $50 million, respectively. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by J. Bratton Davis and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Davis and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York."
