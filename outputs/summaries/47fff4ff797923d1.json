  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Roman F. Montano, Sr., who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, alleges that, in August 2009, Montano consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Montano also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the SEC's orders.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Mr. Miller agreed to a permanent injunction and to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Mexico today announced criminal charges against Montano.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, from approximately June 2009 through June 2014, defendant, who was represented by private counsel at the time of the alleged incident, made a strategic decision to withdraw his plea, not because of the non-existent DNA evidence, but based on the advice of his previous attorney that he need not show prejudice in this matter.  On June 30, 2014, the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Montano to comply with the court order.  As set forth in the SEC order, the SEC seeks permanent injunctions, a conduct-based injunction, and the return of any civil penalty that may be imposed.  Additionally, the complaint seeks a preliminary injunction against future violations and a permanent officer- and director-bar.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-058 (January 24, 2019).  The case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Public Defender's Office.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Eric R. Werner and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner, Ms. Velarde, and Ms. Hood. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Mexico State Attorney General's Office, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice Criminal Investigations, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the U.K. Secret Service."
