  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment finding that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in 2014, David and Jambulat Tkhilaishvili approached Torosyan about opening a suboxone clinic in Quincy, Massachusetts. According to the complaint, the defendants agreed to settle the Hobbs Act's charges by agreeing to pay a special $'400,000 penalty and to be barred from participating in the offering of the clinic. The complaint also alleges that David, who was the sole investor in the clinic, repeatedly threatened Torosyeva with a gun and threatened to \"burn down the clinic\" if the clinic did not receive reimbursements from insurance companies. The defendants allegedly used the money to make the payments to their friend, who had no involvement in constructing or operating the clinic at the time of the alleged embezzlement. The SEC alleges that this conduct constituted a violation of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and that, as a result of this conduct, David was permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public health benefit program. The court agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  To learn more about this matter, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 6, 2020).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office, and the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
