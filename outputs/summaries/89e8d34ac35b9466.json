  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered an amended judgment in favor of K&K, Inc., a Kansas City, Missouri real estate company, and its president, Mia Jamison, finding that they violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson County, Missouri, alleges that the court erred in finding the existence of a binding settlement agreement and entered an Amended Judgment on July 9, 2018.  According to the complaint, Jamison made numerous statements to the court that she was surprised by the terms of the settlement and that she had not given authorization for her attorney to enter into the settlement.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Jamison failed to provide sworn testimony to support her assertion that the settlement was not entered into.  As alleged, the court improperly entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Jamison from violating the federal securities laws and orders her to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,250,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the amended judgment, which permanently restrains the asset freeze and freezes Jamison's assets and provides for the appointment of a receiver for the estate.  On October 29, 2018, the SEC filed an amended complaint against Jamison and her company, M&L&J, Inc. (M&L &J), alleging that she violated Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") Rule 10b2-1 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar.  To settle the case, the parties agreed to pay a $1 million civil penalty, and the settlement is subject to court approval.  Jamison also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the public company.  She also agreed not to participate in the offering of a penny stock, which would be subject to approval by the court.  Finally, the Court granted the parties' motion for a temporary restraining order against further violations of the securities laws, ordered Jamison to return her allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, ordered her to sign a cease and desist order, and ordered the settlement to be entered as a final judgment.   The settlement was approved on October 29 by the SEC, without the court's finding that it was not in the best interest of the parties."
