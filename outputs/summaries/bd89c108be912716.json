  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a California-based real estate agent who misclassified himself as an independent contractor.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 16, 2013, filed in federal court in Seattle, California, Scott J. Armstrong of Danville, Washington, alleges that, as a Contract Field Agent, he was required to sign a contract that required him to pay all of the costs of litigating claims in a settled arbitration proceeding.  The complaint alleges that Armstrong, who lives in Danville and worked as a contract field agent in California, misclassified him as a contractor because he agreed to perform certain work activities in the field and away from an office, including taking prospective residential home buyers on home tours, providing access to properties for home inspections and appraisals, conducting open houses at homes that were for sale, and conducting open house events at homes for sale.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Armstrong consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Armstrong.  Armstrong agreed to settle the charges by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws.  He also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that he will pay in the future.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Mr. Armstrong and Ms. Basinger. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Insurance, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
