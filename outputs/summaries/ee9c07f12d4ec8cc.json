  "summary": "The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against a Florida-based energy company and its former president for making false statements to investors in connection with a three-year contract renewal.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that PowerSecure International, Inc. and former president and CEO Sidney Hinton violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Hinton and PowerSecure agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Hinton.  Hinton has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $2.5 million, prejudgment interest of $1.8 million, and a civil penalty of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 7, 2014, PowerSecure reported a first quarter loss of almost $4.3 million as its cost of sales increased 34% and operating expenses grew by 39%.  The company's stock price rose more than 10 percent that same day, and Hinton sold 200,000 shares of his PowerSecure stock.  As alleged in the SEC's amended complaint, the company's share price increased 39% on the news of the contract renewal, which Hinton knew would result in a loss of approximately $49 million and a $2 million penalty for the company.
