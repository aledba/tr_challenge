  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Davor Rom and his companies for fraudulently inducing investors to purchase Ohio real estate from shell companies established and controlled by Rom.  According to the SEC's complaint, between 2013 and 2015, Rom, through his companies Assets Unlimited, LLC, Investor Income Properties, LLC (IIP), and IIP Ohio, engaged in fraudulent inducement, negligent misrepresentation, and DTPA violations.  The complaint alleges that Rom falsely represented to investors that the properties he was selling had certain qualities as investments, such as a long-term rental tenant, and that the real estate investments had \"comprehensive process for the acquisition, stabilization, management, and performance of investment properties with 10-20% [return on investment].\"  In reality, according to the complaint, none of the investors received double-digit returns on their investments, and Rom gave excuses for payment delays, requested more money, or ignored their inquiries.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed criminal charges against Rom for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, Inc. (Advisers), (3) and (4) that Rom is liable for violations of Section 17(a)(1) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Rom consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay $371,865.59 in disgorgement, $23,861.15 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $189,345.78.  Rom also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC encourages investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.
