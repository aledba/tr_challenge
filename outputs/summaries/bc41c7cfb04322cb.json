  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois on May 23, 2018, entered a final judgment in favor of the school district's motion for administrative review against former school principal Dorothy Crawley.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that Crawley falsely characterized certain days for which she was absent from work as \u201csick days\u201d although she was not, in fact, sick. The complaint also alleges that she falsified her time off on October 22 and October 23, 2015, by using sick days while attending a \"pre-planned vacation on a Caribbean cruise,\" when neither the charges nor the specifications raised \"theft\" as a basis for dismissal. In addition, the complaint alleges that when Crawley was off, her students were damaged because their lesson plans and pedagogical continuity were disrupted because of the disruption caused by her use of sick time.  According to the complaint, the Board's decision to terminate Crawley for this conduct was in violation of Section 34-85 of the School Code, which governs Chicago schoolteachers and specifically defines irremediable conduct.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the Illinois Secretary of State's Office issued an order suspending Crawley from serving as an officer or director of a public school district for five years. The order also prohibits the Board from appointing a hearing officer or appointing an independent auditor to review the disciplinary history of a school district. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On May 24, the Chicago Board of Education approved an order imposing an administrative proceeding against Crawley, which is subject to court approval. The court's order also imposed a temporary restraining order and ordered the district to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The district's investigation, which was conducted by Lawrence Cohen and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Chicago Regional Office, is continuing. The litigation will be led by Mr. Cohen. The case is being supervised by Ansu Banerjee. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Analysis and Detection Center, which uses data analysis tools to detect patterns of misconduct, such as whether a teacher has a legitimate diagnosed medical condition requiring time off, and whether there is a need to employ substitute teachers. The examiners will determine whether to recommend disciplinary actions based on the findings of the SEC's investigation. The hearing officer will be reviewed by the Division of Education's Office of Professional Education and the Chicago Office of Education Counsel. The investigation is being conducted by Edward R. Cohen, under the supervision of Jennifer C. McKinley."
