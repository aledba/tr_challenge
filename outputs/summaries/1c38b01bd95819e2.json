  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against the City of San Antonio d/b/a CPS Energy, a Texas-based public utilities company, for its failure to respond to an emergency call or respond to a driving hazard.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Antonio, Texas, Smith alleged that he was driving his motorcycle on an exit ramp from Interstate Highway 10 to Interstate Highway 37 when he hit a light pole that had fallen onto the roadway.  The complaint alleges that Smith failed to timely remove the light pole from the roadway and in failing to warn the driver of the downed light pole.  Smith also alleged that CPS Energy was negligent in not timely removing the downed pole and in not alerting the driver.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, CPS Energy consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Smith arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Mascianica entered a temporary restraining order against Smith, freezing his assets, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the San Antonio Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by David A. Burt and Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
