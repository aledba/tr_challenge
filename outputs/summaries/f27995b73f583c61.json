  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a Kansas man who was sentenced to 31 months in prison for a sexually violent felony.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, on August 10, 2009, the Kansas Department of Corrections (DOL) issued a recommendation to Lehman to serve a mandatory lifetime of postrelease supervision after he had completed his original sentence. According to the complaint, the DOL recommended that Lehman serve the mandatory minimum of 24 months, which is required for a person to complete a sentence on or after July 1, 2006. The complaint also alleges that the District Court improperly imposed a mandatory minimum sentence on Lehman, which required him to complete his sentence within 24 months of his release from custody. Lehman agreed to the court's order and agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the double jeopardy provisions of the federal and state constitutions. The court granted Lehman's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty. The SEC also issued an order suspending Lehman from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the SEC's order. The order also ordered Lehman not to violate the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Lehman consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, and orders him to repay the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Kansas today announced criminal charges against Lehman. The case is being handled by Scott A. Thompson, Kelly L. Gibson, and Amy C. Welshhans. The litigation will be led by Mr. Thompson and Ms. Gibson. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Kansas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kansas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
