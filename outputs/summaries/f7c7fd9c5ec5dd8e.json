  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment in favor of Quindarius Keshun Morton, Jr., a Gwinnett County, Ga., resident who was convicted in 2015 of felony drug possession.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on January 1, 2015, Morton was contacted by his friend, Levi Brockman, in order to arrange a drug transaction at the Ivy Reserve Apartments. According to the complaint, Morton took out a handgun and cocked it for just in case he was going to be shot. The complaint further alleges that when confronted by Bien-Amin, Morton replied, \"I'm scared and protecting myself when I shot the victim.\"  The complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, charges Morton with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Georgia today announced criminal charges against Morton arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint. The SEC also announced related administrative proceedings against Brockman and Myers, which were conducted by the SEC's Office of Professional Regulation.  On May 2, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Morton, charging him with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 5(d) of the Exchange Act, and with aiding and abetting Morton's violations of Section 10(b) of Exchange Act Rules 5-5-20, 5-c, and 5-d-8 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC, Morton consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5-20-20."
