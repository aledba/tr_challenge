  "summary": "On June 3, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that the EPA violated Rule 17a-5 by failing to provide a reasoned explanation for its decision to remove a class of EPA grant recipients from serving as members of advisory committees.  According to the complaint, the EPA also failed to provide any reasonable explanation for why it removed a member of an advisory committee who was not in receipt of an EPA grant.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as a result of the EPA's action, no member of the advisory committee was able to offer independent scientific advice to the agency.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the agency has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and orders the agency to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of money it has already paid to the receiver of the agency's grant. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2019 (Aug. 24, 2019).  The U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the SEC.  On August 23, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the EPA, charging that the agency violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and Rule 12(b)(2) and 13a-14 thereunder, and that the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations of the APA and Rules 12b-1, 12a-13, and 13b-20 thereunder and an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent investigation of the matter.
