  "summary": "On August 22, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment in favor of the government in a civil injunctive action brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) against the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) for unlawfully withholding documents related to the Stellar Wind program.  The court's order, which is subject to court approval, orders the release of the documents in the interests of the public.  In its order, the court found that the DOJ violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the disclosure of the requested documents.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the DOJ consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director and penny stock bars.  On August 26, 2016, the Court granted the ACLU's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the agency's assets and assets, as well as an order appointing a receiver to oversee the collection and processing of documents requested by the ACLU.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan on May 13, 2013, the District Court entered a judgment against the DOJ, finding that the agency violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The Court also ordered the DOJ to comply with the order by issuing an order requiring it to provide a copy of the OLC 10 documents to the court in a timely fashion.  As part of the settlement, the government agreed to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and the agency agreed to disgorge $2,500 in ill-advised profits with prejudgement interest, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000.  It also agreed to the issuance of an order permanently enjoining the DOJ from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the Exchange Act, and ordering the DOJ and the FBI to jointly and severally comply with those provisions.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by David A. Cohen and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by John R. Kasper and Ms. Cohen.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security in this matter."
