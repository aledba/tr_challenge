  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island today entered a final judgment against two New Jersey men who were charged with failing to rehabilitate.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Providence, Rhode Island, alleges that Brian P. and his father, Shane M., violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17a-112 of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the court improperly terminated their parental rights.  According to the complaint, the defendants' drug use and addiction caused them to lose their home, a car, and an engagement ring.  In addition, the court found that the defendants had failed to achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation to be able to assume a responsible position in the life of Brian P., despite repeated efforts to do so.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the respondents have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties of up to $1,000. The court also ordered the respondents to participate in a diversionary program, which is intended to encourage the return of the children to their families.  On June 7, 2019, the SEC filed an emergency action against the defendants, seeking to bar them from future violations of the federal securities laws.  To learn more about diversionary programs, see Litigation Release No. 587, 585, and 142 A.3d 1247 (2015).  The complaint also seeks to bar the defendants from serving as officers or directors of a public company, from participating in any offering of a penny stock, from purchasing or selling any security-related product, and from providing or providing services to a family member or business associate.   In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the three defendants.  This action is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and to identify whether their backgrounds are relevant.  For example, the complaint alleges that one of the defendants tested positive for opiates in August 2018. The complaint further alleges that the other defendant tested positive"
