  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho today entered a final judgment in favor of a mother who agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boise, Idaho, alleges that the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare improperly terminated the mother's parental rights to her son, A.V. The complaint alleges that, in November 2017, the court found that the mother had neglected her son by failing to adequately supervise and supervise his developmentally delayed mother and two sisters. The court also found that, based upon the mother and father's neglect, the termination was in the best interests of the child.  According to the complaint, however, this finding was not supported by the evidence presented in the court's judgment.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the mother.  On May 24, 2019, the U. S. District Judge for the Central District of California entered a judgment against the state that permanently enjoins the mother from future violations of Section 16-2002 and 16-1602, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the mother consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains her parental rights and prohibits her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in connection with the termination of mother's rights. The final judgment also orders the court to determine whether to impose a permanent injunction, impose a conduct-based injunction, and impose a $25,000 civil penalty.   The court's order also prohibits the mother, father, or guardian from acting as an unregistered broker-dealer in a child protective act case, and from imposing a penny stock bar against her or her family. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson, Ms. Barry, and Mr. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Idaho Office of Child and Family Education, and the Idaho State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
