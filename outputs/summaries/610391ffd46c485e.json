  "summary": "On July 10, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky entered a final judgment against Scott H. and Richard F. Dahlson in a civil action brought by investors in Kentucky.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kentucky, H.E.B. and Dahlson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC alleges that Haire, a Kentucky resident, and Dahlsson, a Texas resident, aided and abetted Haire's violations of the federal securities laws.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Dahlson and Haire provided legal services to HEB and assisted Haire in preparing for his guilty plea and the potential resolution of his criminal case.  As alleged in the complaint, Haire also assisted in drafting a plan for Haire to take control of WMT, VHGI and RedFin, a third public company in which HEB was heavily invested, by illegally acquiring a significant number of HEB-owned shares in all three companies.  Haire resigned all corporate leadership positions in Kentucky in late May 2012.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000 each.  Dahlson has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  JW, Dahlson, and their Kentucky-based law firm, Wound Management Technologies, Inc., have agreed to settle the case by consenting to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of their respective profits with interest and civil penalties, and to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 454.210(2)(a)(1).  The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Kentucky Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2"
