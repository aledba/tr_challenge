  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Indiana today announced criminal charges against a Dubois County man accused of threatening members of a church with a gun.  According to the SEC's complaint, on February 28, 2015, Josh McBride, a resident of Anderson Valley Christian Church, received a no trespass letter from a member of the church. McBride allegedly told the member that he was going to shoot his neighbor and that he would \"go get a 45\" if the neighbor asked him to stop shooting his gun. The complaint alleges that McBride did not fire the gun, but instead took the opportunity to brandish and discharge a firearm at the neighbor. The SEC alleges that the alleged threat came from within the church's property line, and McBride continued to fire his gun into the ground, causing the church to shake and the members of the congregation to fear for their lives.  McBride also allegedly used a four-wheeler to drive past the church, which he claimed was being targeted by drug dealers.  The complaint further alleges that one of McBride's dogs bit Madden, causing him to fear that the dog bite victim would be injured.  As alleged in the complaint, McBride then threatened to \"shoot up\" the church and cause it to shake again.  In a parallel action, the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against McBride that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The court also ordered McBride to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and imposing a $25,000 officer- and director bar.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Scott W. Brewington and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Gibson, and the case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the FBI in this matter."
