  "summary": "On May 2, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Minnesota entered a final judgment in favor of the tax court in a case brought by Inland Edinburgh Festival, LLC against Daniel T. Boris, who agreed to pay $9,384,300 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 2, 2015, in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, Boris raised the issue of market value when he presented his own valuation analysis of the property, which he estimated at $8.384 million using both income and sales-comparison approaches. The complaint alleges that Boris's initial opinion, which was admitted at trial, contained mathematical errors related to rental rates and other errors that were not supported by the data presented in his report. The tax court ultimately rejected Boris\u2019s valuation determination based on a failure to adequately explain the basis for his opinion.  The complaint further alleges that, in its final judgment, the court found that the property was not valued at market value because it did not consider recent sales of the same property when determining its valuation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Boris consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a penalty of $10,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Boris. The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.

Dumornay of the Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Gregory Kasper and Mr. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.
