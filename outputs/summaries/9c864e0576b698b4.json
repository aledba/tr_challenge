  "summary": "On April 12, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a temporary restraining order against a Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFS) mother who filed a complaint to terminate her parental rights to her child, A.R.M.K.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, alleges that, in June of 2018, the DFS issued an order terminating the parental rights of a two-month-old child. The complaint alleges that Mother signed an affidavit of relinquishment, which was signed in conjunction with a post-adoption agreement between the parents and the paternal aunt. According to the complaint, the affidavit was obtained as a result of fraud and was obtained by a notary public who was not prepared for a contested trial. The SEC alleges that the Department violated Section 161.103 of the Texas Family Code and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Department has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins Mother from violating the antifraud, duress, and coercion provisions of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Mother arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  In a related administrative proceeding, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Mother, charging her with violations of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting Mother's violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Advisers\"). The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the Fort Worth Regional Office, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Gaunt."
