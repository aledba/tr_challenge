  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered summary judgment in favor of the defendants in a mortgage foreclosure action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that on September 12, 2008, the defendants borrowed $221,937.26 from Salin Bank and Trust Company (Salin), signed a note and mortgage, and obtained a mortgage on certain real property in Noblesville, N.Y.  According to the complaint, Salin charged the Hussains with a $20,000 NSF fee for executing the loan and mortgage. The complaint further alleges that Salin allegedly misappropriated the loan principal, which was paid in full by the borrower, and inflated the principal balance by $2,104.42.  In a parallel action, on June 28, 2016, a federal district court in Manhattan granted summary judgment for Salin.  On July 29, 2019, the SEC filed a motion for summary judgment against Salin, finding that the defendants had violated the business records exception, which requires defendants to show cause and effect of a judgment, whether to disgorge their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and whether to pay civil penalties in the amount of $242,718.47.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $1,500,000, which is equal to the amount owed to Salin by Salin in the default of the loan, and a civil penalty of $250,000. The defendants also agreed to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  As part of the settlement, the court agreed to the payment of a $1 million civil penalty, which will be determined by the court at a later date. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-19."
