  "summary": "On October 4, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Shawna Johnson, a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for a felony conviction for domestic violence.  The court found that, under the federal law, a person with a prior felony conviction is entitled to a right to keep and bear arms for self-defense.  According to the court's order, Johnson was not eligible to acquire or possess a firearm because of her prior conviction.  Instead, the court held that she had not committed a felony within 20 years, that her criminal history and her reputation indicated that she was not likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety, and that granting her relief under section 10 of the federal gun control law would not be contrary to federal law.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Johnson.  Johnson has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of her penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Johnson has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the above-mentioned federal statutes, ordering her to comply with the court order, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty. The court also granted Johnson a temporary restraining order prohibiting her from using or selling any firearm, and ordered the issuance of a FOID card. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Chicago Regional Office by Michael J. McCluskey and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Attorney General's Office, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
