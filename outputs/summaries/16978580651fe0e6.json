  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Brian Anthony Dominguez, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to twelve years in prison for his role in a drug-related scheme.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, Colorado, alleges that, from at least September 2013 through September 2015, Domingue made numerous statements to a jury that were inadmissible because they were not consistent with the facts of the case. For example, as alleged in the complaint, the defendant allegedly told one of the jury that he was going to give them information that would lead them to believe that he had a legitimate intent to sell the drug. The complaint further alleges that Domingu\u00c3\u00b1oz, who was a member of the West Metro Drug Task Force at the time of his arrest, allegedly had a large bag containing nearly half a pound of methamphetamine, a small spoon, and a large spoon, which appeared to be the size used to fill the smaller baggies, and that he followed the defendant for a short time in traffic before attempting a traffic stop. The SEC alleges that the jury was told that the defendant had a reasonable doubt about the accuracy of the evidence presented in the court's order. The court agreed to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendant to pay disgorgement of $1,038,078, plus prejudgment interest of $2,065, and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Colorado today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  According to the SEC, the jury deliberated for over an hour before deciding whether to grant the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, impose a civil monetary penalty, and order the defendant and his family to pay civil penalties of $150,000 each.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, defendants consented to the issuance of the Final Judgment, which requires the court to determine whether a defendant is entitled to a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a)(1) and (3) and 17(b)(2) the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(3) of The Securities Act of 1933, and Section 13(a) of Exchange Act Rules 206(4)-8 thereunder. The final judgment orders the defendants to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains, pay civil interest, and pay a penalty in the amount of $10,000"
