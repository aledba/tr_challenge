  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against ICRA Sapphire, a California-based company accused of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Diego, California, alleges that, in late July 2011, a trial judge imposed sanctions pursuant to Section 128.7 of the Exchange Act for violations of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1.  According to the complaint, the court found that, contrary to the defendants' representations, the November 14\u201315 document was not the final expression of the agreement, and that the letter attached to the wrong draft of the contract was not a true and correct copy of the actual agreement.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to adequately communicate to counsel with the seriousness of their violations, failed to inform counsel of the risks of incorrect verification, and failed even to respond to a call alerting opposing counsel to the error.  Finally, the SEC alleges that in a parallel action, the trial judge issued an order to vacate the sanction order on June 22, 2012.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the judge also ordered the defendants to pay $5,076.16 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $10,000.  On June 24, 2012, a federal judge in Sacramento issued a temporary restraining order against the defendants, ordering them to comply with the court's order, and ordering the SEC to pay a $7,500 civil penalty.  After the court issued the order, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $20,000 each.  As a result of the judgment, the defendant and his counsel will be barred from appearing before the court as part of a settled administrative proceeding, and the court will determine the appropriate amount of monetary penalties to be imposed upon them.
