  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Missouri-based healthcare company and its CEO in an opioid-related civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Dr. Henry Walden and St. Louis University violated the antifraud provisions of Section 538.210 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Dr. Walden was not aware of the opioid epidemic when he prescribed opioids to Koon, and he did not know that there was a high probability that Koon would become dependent on the opioid treatment.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Walden failed to weigh the risks and benefits of opioid prescriptions and failed to adequately monitor Koon's opioid use.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their ill-gotten gains.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2012, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $15,000, which would be equal to their respective civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000.   The court also granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered them to comply with the court order.  To learn more about liability, see Litigation Release No. 538-210 (Mo. App. W.D. 2008).  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent investigation into opioid misuse and abuse, and that the SEC is seeking an asset freeze and other emergency relief. \u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
