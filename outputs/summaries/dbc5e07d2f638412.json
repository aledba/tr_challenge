  "summary": "The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Texas yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of the Debtors' motion to voluntarily dismiss their bankruptcy case.  According to the SEC's complaint, in 2009, Manuel Palomera Lopez and Dolores Ronquillo Lopez filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code alleging that they were in arrears with their plan payments. The complaint alleges that the debtors sold their homestead and did not use the proceeds to pay for the plan payment. Instead, according to the complaint, they used the proceeds for personal expenses and to purchase a second home. The SEC alleges that, in 2011, the bankruptcy court granted the debtsors' request for a temporary restraining order and ordered them to return the homestead proceeds to their creditors.  The complaint further alleges that in 2014, a bankruptcy court ruled that the debts were entitled to the return of the proceeds because they voluntarily dismissed their case. The court also ruled that, under \u00a7\u201c349(b)(3) of the Bankrupt Code, a trustee has a duty to return to the debtor all property of the estate held by him or her at the time of the dismissal and to take no further steps to implement the chapter 13 plan.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay $42,148.58 in pre-petition sale proceeds plus $1,100 in post-mortgage interest, and to pay civil penalties of up to $100,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the U. S. District Court for New York granted the Debtor's request for an emergency asset freeze and ordered the receivership of the remaining assets in the estate to be conducted by the trustee. The bankruptcy court also issued an order requiring the receiver to repatriate the proceeds from the sale of a homestead property to the trustee upon the trustee's motion to dismiss as well as to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which the trustee has already agreed to.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Rymas and Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms."
