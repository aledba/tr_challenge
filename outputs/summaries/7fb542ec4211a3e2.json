  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alaska today entered a final judgment against the Municipality of Anchorage for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Anchorage, Alaska, alleges that the Anchorage Municipal Board (AMB) unlawfully imposed special assessments on lots located in a residential neighborhood called Turnagain Heights, Alaska.  According to the complaint, the AMB imposed the special assessments based on evidence that property owners had received some benefit from the improvement district projects.  In addition, the complaint alleges that AMB improperly \"shifted\" about $1 million in project costs from the original AMB to the new AMB, which is required by state law.  AMB also improperly included $834,542 in costs from another municipal utility project unrelated to the improvement districts.  As alleged, AMB failed to determine the true costs of the improvements, and AMB did not apply to the rest of the properties affected by AMB's special assessments.   The complaint further alleges that, contrary to representations made in the representations, the property owners were not entitled to a fair allocation of the funds allocated to the projects and were instead forced to hold the bag for the remainder of the project costs.  Additionally, the Property Owners' complaint alleges, among other things, that the municipality improperly \"allocated\" certain of the projects' costs in a way that did not comply with the requirements of the municipal code.  Specifically, they are alleging that the municipal board improperly allocated millions of dollars in special assessments to certain properties in violation of AMB\u2019s requirements.  AmB also failed to recognize that certain of those special assessments exceeded the amount of money allocated to those properties.  For example, the court found that the property owner had a weak basis to complain even if the project cost was inflated by excessive design, engineering, and surveying costs, and that the contractor had a reasonable basis to pay for the project.  Finally, the Court found that, in a parallel action, the District of Anchorage violated AMB Section 9.02(e) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint filed in the SEC, the district property owners consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the AMAB and Rule 9b2-1, and require them to pay disgorgement of $2,538,137, prejudgment interest of $1,323,768, and a civil penalty of $100,000. \u00c2\u00a0The settlements are subject to court approval.
