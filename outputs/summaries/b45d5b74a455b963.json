  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Qualcomm Inc., a microcap company, and three other companies for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that Qualcomm violated the anti-fraud provision of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a preliminary injunction, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  According to the complaint, the defendants have agreed to settle the case by agreeing to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty, which is equal to the amount of their profits.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On August 2, 2018, the U. S. District Judge in San Francisco entered a temporary restraining order against Qualcomm and ordered the defendants to pay $1,500,000 in civil penalties, and a $100,000 civil penalty for each of them.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Qualcomm consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay civil penalties of $1 million, $500, and $150,000, respectively. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The court's order also prohibits the defendants from violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) or of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\") or Rule 13b2-1 thereunder. The court will determine the appropriate amount of relief. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by David A. Cohen and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the San Diego Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Cohen."
