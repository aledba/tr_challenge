  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Ishaihu Harmelech, who owned and operated multiple cable installation companies, on two counts of mail fraud.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, between 2005 and 2011, Harmelemlech engaged in a scheme to fraudulently open hundreds of DIRECTV customer accounts, often using the personally identifying information of residents without their knowledge. As alleged in the complaint, the scheme was for his own financial benefit, and he did not benefit from the scheme.  The SEC alleges that Harmel\u00e9ch violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, however, the defendant agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $21 million, prejudgment interest of $1.8 million, and a civil penalty of $3,511,917 a year, or $21,071,502 for years 2005-2010.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New York announced criminal charges against the defendant, who was also charged with mail fraud in connection with the same scheme. The SEC also obtained a temporary restraining order, which temporarily halted the alleged mail fraud, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering them to pay civil penalties of $2.6 million and $1 million, respectively.  To settle the SEC case, the defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to pay a $1,477,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221.   \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and\u00c2\u00a0investors.\u00c2\u00a0There is\u00c2\u00a0no such thing as a \"clear and firm conviction\" that a defendant is entitled to a four-level enhancement."
