  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment in favor of a motion for a new trial against a Florida man charged with the murder of a woman who was incapacitated due to drug use.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that, on August 10, 2011, Furrukh Shan Alam, a resident of Maitland, Fla., was shot and killed by a man who claimed to have used a gun in the days leading up to the shooting. According to the complaint, Alam confronted Alam and told him that he had a duty to retreat when he saw Fuller and two women come out of his bathroom with \"evidence of cocaine use.\" The complaint alleges that Alam replied, \"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.\"  The complaint charges Fuller with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The complaint seeks a preliminary injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for Florida today announced criminal charges against Alam. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Alam, charging him with violating Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1, and with aiding and abetting Alam's and Alam's violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17a-1 thereunder. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and the appointment of a receiver for the receiver of the receiver's receiver.  On March 1, 2016, the Florida Court of Appeals issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent and cumulative review of all of the relevant evidence before it can issue a judgment imposing a judgment that permanently enjoins the SEC from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws. The order also provides for the issuance of an order appointing a receiver of receiver bars, which is subject to court approval.
