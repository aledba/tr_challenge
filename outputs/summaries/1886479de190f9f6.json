  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against a former Elgin Police Department detective for his role in a 2015 drug-related scheme.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Chicago, Tom Wolek of Elgin, Illinois, was charged with possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver within 1000 feet of a church and driving while his license was revoked.  The complaint alleges that Woleck, who previously worked for the department for 20 years, conducted a drug investigation in which he conducted a series of undercover operations, including conducting a traffic stop on a car that was being driven by a convicted felon. The complaint further alleges that defendant, who had been previously convicted of a felony, used a collapsible metal baton to carry out the undercover operation. The SEC alleges that the collapsible baton was not a \"bludgeon\" and that defendant did not possess a simple nightstick or a nightstick. Rather, it was a metal expandable baton, which was similar to batons issued to police officers \"for use of force [and] protection.\"  The SEC also alleges that, based on the evidence presented in the complaint, defendant failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he possessed a bludgeon or that he intended to deliver the drugs.  In a parallel action, the Illinois Attorney General's Office today announced that it has issued an asset freeze and an officer-and-officer bar.  On May 6, 2016, the court granted a motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered a hearing on May 11, 2016. The court granted the request for a preliminary injunction and ordered the hearing to be conducted in the light of the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The order also prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public company, from purchasing or selling any security, and from participating in any offering of a penny stock or offering of any security-related security. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing scheduled for May 12, 2016 will be conducted on May 13, 2016 and will be led by James Bisceglie. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The hearing will be supervised by Amy C. Welshhans and Glenn S. Gordon. The litigation is being led by David A. Kasper and supervised by Eric R. Werner."
