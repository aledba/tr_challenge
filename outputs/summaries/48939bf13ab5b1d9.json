  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska today entered a final judgment against Elizabeth L. McElderry, a family permanency specialist who worked with Elizabeth and her two children, for terminating her parental rights.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Omaha, Nebraska, Elizabeth was the biological mother of Lizabella R., born in January 2015, and Jose R. born in February 2016. The children have different biological fathers. The complaint alleges that, as a result of Elizabeth\u2019s incarceration, she was unable to provide for and take care of her children.  The complaint further alleges that Elizabeth failed to complete relinquishment counseling when she was incarcerated and failed to file for removal following her release from prison.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Elizabeth. The SEC also charged Elizabeth with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and injunctive relief.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Elizabeth consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of Section 43-292(2) and orders her to pay a civil penalty of 10 years, with the amount of restitution to be determined by the court at a later date. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Scott A. Thompson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Nebraska Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Nebraska Office of Children and Family Education."
