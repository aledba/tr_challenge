  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the County of Santa Cruz for failing to adequately consider the potential environmental impacts of a proposed hotel expansion.  The court also issued an order requiring the County to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIR) for any project that may have significant environmental impacts.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Santa Cruz, California, the Commission on Environmental Quality (CEQA) recommended that the County prepare an EIR for a project that would substantially impact the quality of the county\u2019s land use and development plans. The complaint also alleges that the Commission improperly prepared a negative declaration for a hotel expansion that did not meet CEQA requirements. The Commission concluded that the hotel expansion was not a significant impact on the environment and should not be included in the EIR.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, contrary to the Commission's recommendation, the County failed to adequately assess the potential impacts of the proposed hotels and failed to take into account the potential for future development.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission&rsquo;s complaint, the Complaint alleges that Aptos County violated the antifraud provisions of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) thereunder of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 17a-3 thereunder. The Complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  On March 19, 2019, the court granted the Commission a temporary restraining order and ordered the Commission to conduct an environmental review of the hotels and related projects.  A hearing is scheduled for May 26, 2019.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5172 (January 24, 2019).  The Commission's investigation was conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Environmental Education and Advocacy, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Basinger. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Environmental Quality, the Caltrans Corporation, the Santa Cruz County Office of Planning and Inspections, the San Diego County Department of Natural Resources, the Department of Economic and Risk Analysis and the California Office of Environmental Health and Science."
