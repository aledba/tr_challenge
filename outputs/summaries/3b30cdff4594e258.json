  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Jason L. Watkins, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 67 years in prison for a string of nonhomicide crimes.  According to the court's order, on October 12, 2011, a Franklin County jury indicted Watkins for six counts of aggravated robbery in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that Watkins violated the mandatory minimum prison sentence provisions of the federal securities laws.  In its judgment, the court held that a mandatory minimum sentence for a juvenile offender with a life-without-parole sentence should not be imposed on a juvenile who did not commit a serious criminal act.  Without admitting or denying the findings of the court, Watkins consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the provisions of Sections 13(a)(1) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (3)(B)(3) of The Securities Act, and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar.  Watkins also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to be restrained from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of a penny stock or offering of any security, including the right to reapply after five years of incarceration.  On November 23, 2013, the Court of Common Pleas granted Watkins' motion to withdraw his guilty plea, ordered the preparation of a presentence investigation, and scheduled a sentencing hearing for Watkins on December 22, 2016.  As set forth in the order, Watkins agreed to a permanent injunction and to a five-year conduct-based injunction, which prohibits him from associating with any person who has committed a serious felony with a defendant who has a meaningful opportunity to reenter society with a meaningful and productive life outside of prison.   The Court also granted Watkins a temporary restraining order, which requires him to comply with the requirements of Section 12(b).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Watkins. The SEC's Office of Criminal Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced parallel criminal prosecutions against Watkins and another defendant.  Among other things, the SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation is being led by"
