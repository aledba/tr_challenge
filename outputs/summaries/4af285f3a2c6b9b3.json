  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a medical malpractice action.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Richard S. Veyna, M.D., Michigan Head and Spine Institute (MHSI), and University Neurosurgical Associates, PC (UNA) violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to timely file and timely respond to a complaint with the court.  According to the complaint, Veyna and UNA failed to comply with MCR 2.112(L)(2)(a) and MCR 600.2912b, which requires defendants to file a timely NOI before filing a complaint.  In addition, the SEC alleges that defendants failed to timely reply to the NOI filed by MHSI or UNA, despite repeated requests by the defendants to do so.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  UNA also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer and director of a public company.
