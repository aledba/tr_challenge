  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment in favor of the Wake County Division of Social Services (DSS) in a civil injunctive action brought by Latonya A. Taylor against Nathan Lorenzo Holden, the estranged husband of Sylvester and Anglia Taylor.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in January 2014, the DSS became involved with the affairs of the Taylor family after reports of domestic violence led the plaintiff to obtain an Ex-Parte Domestic Violence Protective Order (DVPO) following a report that Holden threatened to kill her and her children.  According to the complaint, as alleged in the SEC's Complaint against Holden, DSS violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the North Carolina Constitution and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the Judge granted the Court's motion for summary judgment against the defendants, and ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for North Carolina announced criminal charges against one of the defendants for his role in a similar conduct.   The court also issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendants' assets, and ordering the destruction of any evidence that may have been obtained from the alleged violations of DSS' policies and procedures.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Robert C. Hannan of the U.N. District court for the Eastern District of South Carolina granted the court's order against the defendant, granting summary judgment, and appointing a receiver to determine whether to proceed with a civil action against the individual defendants in the future.  A hearing for the receiver has been scheduled for 9 January 2014 for a hearing scheduled for 10:30 a.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the State Department of Health and Human Services, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
