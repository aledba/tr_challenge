  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against Michael Benjamin, a defendant who was convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon (ADW), D.C. Code \u00a7 22-402 (2019) and sentenced to 10 years in prison.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia on January 25, 2017, alleges that Benjamin and his co-defendant, Irik C. Wynn, were charged with assaulting Smith on October 20, 2016. The complaint alleges that, on the day of the assault, Benjamin and Wynn confronted Smith about his drug debt and agreed that Smith would pay the debt in two days. According to the complaint, after learning that Smith was lying to the police, Benjamin confronted him about the debt and told him that he had identified a \"name and a specific description\" of the person who had allegedly attacked Smith. Benjamin allegedly left his car and confronted Smith after he confronted him. The court found that Benjamin had no reasonable reason to believe that Smith had called him after he had confronted him the day before, and that he did not call Smith after the alleged assault. Benjamin also allegedly left a note in his car stating that he was hiding from the police. The SEC alleges that the government's introduction at their joint trial of Benjamin's interview with Detective Chad Howard violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Benjamin has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Benjamin. In a related matter, the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has obtained an asset freeze against Benjamin in connection with a related criminal case. The investigation was conducted by David B. Johnson and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Johnson, Ms. Gibson, and Ms. Johnson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter.   The Office of Professional and Risk Analysis has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments in a business by using\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2"
