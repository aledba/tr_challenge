According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Scott County, Kentucky, Stratton alleges that Portfolio obtained the credit card agreement between Portfolio and Stratton in 2008 and that it was entitled to collect interest of 8% per annum on the debt when it had no right to collect the interest under Kentucky law.  The complaint further alleges that in 2010, when Stratton opened a credit card account with GE Money Bank, she owed $2,630.95 with interest at the rate of 8%, and that in 2012, when GE allegedly waived the contractual interest rate, Portfolio filed a collection action against Stratton.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Portfolio from violating the federal law and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of the debt it has collected.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Strattatt.  On March 29, 2015, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking summary judgment, and a permanent injunction against the defendants.

FINRA has also issued an Investor Alert about potential violations of the fiduciary and reporting requirements of FINRA, including: (1) the reporting requirements for certain issuers; (2) the books and records; (3) the borrower typically delivers to the assignee a written instrument addressed to the debtor directing the debtor to pay all or part of the owed"
