  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a child custody proceeding against his or her mother.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in El Paso, Texas, alleges that, in August 2017, the El Paso County Department of Human Services (DHS) initiated a dependency and neglect case involving seven-month-old M.V., six-year-old Ma.M., and an older half-sibling who is not subject to the court's order.  According to the complaint, the DHS obtained video recordings of mother and the children at the time of the alleged abuse.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the DSH obtained the video recordings without proper authentication, and that the court failed to consider whether the children were in need of care when the child was in the care of the mother or father.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the DSS' complaint, DHS consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendant to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  DHS has also agreed to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-20.  Separately, the Department of Justice today announced that it has obtained a court order requiring it to consider the merits of the case against the defendant.  This order requires the court to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to determine that the child is an Indian child, whether the child has a history of substance use and was on probation for possession of a controlled substance, and whether the court has sufficient jurisdiction to issue an order requiring the child to be placed in the custody of a tribe or other suitable person.  Additionally, the court must determine whether it has sufficient authority to order the child's release from custody.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order against further violations of the federal securities laws, and the court granted the request for a preliminary injunction against further violation of the securities laws. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0"
