  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against Mountain Productions, Inc., a day laborer employed by Conder, Inc. (otherwise known as Charm City Crewing Company), for failing to adequately indemnify its former employee for his fall while working on a concert stage.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on June 30, 2015, James L. Truesdale fell from a platform while working at the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium and died eight days later.  The SEC alleges that Conder and Mountain agreed to indemnify each other for any negligence caused by the other, to provide employees and agents with \"broad oral indemnity in return for services\" that were required by federal workers' compensation laws.  Conder also agreed to add IMP as an additional insured to its commercial general liability insurance policy.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Mountain and Conder have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Conder.  On June 22, 2009, the court granted a temporary restraining order against Mountain and ordered it to return to court on July 4, 2015.  Mountain has agreed to settle the charges against it by consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, as well as to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  It has also agreed not to participate in the issuance of an officer-and-director bar for certain third-party complaints, which will be instituted by the court upon motion by the SEC.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0instant.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and\u00c2\u00a0check whether they have any background in the field of\u00c2\u00a0insurance.gov\u00c2\u00a0that is required, inter alia, by federal employees and/or agents."
