  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Vermont today announced criminal charges against a Vermont-based company accused of defrauding its customers by failing to timely file required registration forms with the Commission.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Burlington, Vermont, SolarCity Corp. (\"SolarCity\") was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(a)(2) and 206(b)(3) of the federal securities laws.  The complaint alleges that the Commission violated the registration requirements for solar net-metering systems, which require the Commission to determine whether a system qualifies as a \"certificate of good conduct\" (CPG).  The SEC alleges that SolarCity failed to timely and adequately file its required filings with the SEC.  In its complaint, the Commission alleged that the company violated Section 248 of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 5.100 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, the complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  On May 9, 2018, the SEC filed a complaint against SolarCity, alleging that it failed to file its requisite registration forms and that it had failed to comply with Commission requirements.  SolarCity consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the Commission from future violations of Section 248, and orders it to conduct an independent investigation of all of the issues raised by the complaint.  It also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by C.J. Kerstetter and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Vermont Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Vermont Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
