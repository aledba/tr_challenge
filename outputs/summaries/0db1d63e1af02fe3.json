  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Federal Correctional Complex, Coleman, Florida, and the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) in an unfair labor practice case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that the agency violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b) thereunder, and that it failed to bargain in good faith with the parties in negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement. The complaint also alleges that, contrary to the SEC's findings, the agency did not have a duty to bargain because the parties had agreed on a \"covered-by\" standard for assigning employees to the sick and annual relief rosters. In addition, the complaint alleged that the agreement did not cover certain \"mission critical\" jobs, such as covering for colleagues out on sick or annual leave.  According to the complaint, the parties did not \"contemplate\" such assignment of employees when negotiating the new agreement. Rather, as the complaint alleges, they did not \u201ccontest\u201d or \u201cprejudge\u201d the impact and implementation of the covered-by provisions of the agreement, and did not require near-supernatural prescience for the parties to have foreclosed bargaining over inter-institutional assignments.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order requiring the agency to post a notice of its failure to bargain with the union during the course of a contract negotiation. The agency has also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 2, 2020, the SEC filed a complaint against the agency alleging that it violated Sections 7116(a)(1) and 7101-7135 of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The case is being handled by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, and Antonia Shalov Mehraban of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Amy S. Cotter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for New York and the Department of Justice in this matter."
