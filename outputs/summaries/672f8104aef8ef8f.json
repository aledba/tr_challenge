  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment against a Somerville man who was convicted of second-degree murder in the second degree.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Somerville, Massachusetts, alleges that, on the evening of November 22, 2009, the defendant, his brother, and their mother, Kelly Murray, went to the victim's apartment to play video game with her brother. The complaint alleges that Murray, who was a drug user, had two video game consoles: an Xbox 360 (Xbox), which he kept in the living room, and a PlayStation 3 (PlayStation) that he sold to Gesse. According to the complaint, Murray's girlfriend discovered a video game console in their apartment the morning after the murder and confronted the defendant about the inconclusive results. Murray allegedly told the defendant that the PlayStation was the same PlayStation that Gesse had stolen from the victim, and that he had used the PlayStation to strangle the victim. Murray also allegedly told his girlfriend that he bought a PlayStation that was missing a power cord from the defendant. The SEC alleges that the defendant admitted to having the PlayStation in the apartment when he was last seen alive and when his body was discovered the next morning, but that he did not have the PlayStation when he left the apartment the night before, and neither the PlayStation nor the power cord had been tested. The court also found that Murray had not provided any corroborating evidence to support the SEC's findings.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Murray.  On November 24, 2018, a federal judge in New York granted a temporary restraining order against Murray and ordered him to surrender his passport. The judge also issued an order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The order also prohibits Murray from participating in any offering of a penny stock or offering to sell the penny stock to the SEC.  A hearing for a new trial has been scheduled for March 5, 2019.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2018."
