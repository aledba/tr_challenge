  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa yesterday entered a final judgment against Valley View Swine, LLC and its principals, JBS Live Pork, Inc., and Valley View Ranch, LLC, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 657.11(5) of the Iowa Code of Civil Procedure.  The court found that the defendants had a losing cause of action, that their claims were not frivolous, and that the district court improperly assessed certain costs and expenses.  According to the court's order, Merrill and Frescoln, who live in Wapello County for swine owned by JBS, agreed to settle the case without prejudice by agreeing to pay $7630.60, $1686.67, and $1531.97, respectively, to settle their claims.  Merrill also agreed to pay a penalty of $1,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to be liable to the person against whom the action was brought for all of the expenses incurred in the defense of the action.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay civil penalties of $750,000 and $16,501, respectively. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a related administrative proceeding, the court also ordered Valley View and JBS to comply with a court order requiring them to provide a copy of the final judgment to each of the parties.  On May 20, 2019, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Honomichl entered a judgment against the defendants, finding them liable for the costs, expenses, and injunctive relief that the court ordered.  He also appointed a receiver to oversee the receiver, which will determine the receiver's jurisdiction over the receiver and the receiver of the receiver.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, and the Iowa Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
