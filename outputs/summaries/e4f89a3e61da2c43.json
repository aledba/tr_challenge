  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a civil injunctive action brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Dale Kleber violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that the defendants violated the pre-Hazen Paper consensus concerning disparate impact claims under the ADEA, which prohibits employers from discriminating based on experience or qualifications when applying for a job. In addition, the complaint alleges that, in violation of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, Kleber was barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the hiring of anyone other than himself or indirectly through his employer.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Kleber.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal on March 5, 2014, the defendants agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint. The settlement, which is subject to court approval, requires the defendants to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil monetary penalty. The defendants also agreed to pay civil penalties of $1,000 each. The settlements are subject to approval by the court. The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Office of Inspector General. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Jennifer Chun Barry and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the FBI and the U.N. Office of Personnel Management."
