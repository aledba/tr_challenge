  "summary": "The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Whole Foods Market, Inc., a California-based grocery-store chain, and several of its executives for defrauding retail investors.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, from at least 2013 through 2015, Whole Foods made numerous false statements about the company's transparency, quality, and corporate responsibility. For example, the complaint alleges that Whole Foods allegedly overcharged its customers by falsely stating that it had \"tare weight\" in the price of its prepackaged products, in violation of national standards and local laws. The complaint further alleges that the defendants failed to disclose to their customers that, in fact, they overcharged their customers by more than $127.7 million.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  According to the complaint, on June 29, 2015, a federal district court in Albany, New York, granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering Whole Foods to pay a civil penalty of $800,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and civil penalties of $100,000 each. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 6, 2016, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California charging Whole Foods with violating the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws and ordering the company to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (Feb. 11, 2015).  The complaint also names as a relief defendant a company controlled by Whole Foods, which is controlled by the company, John Mackey, Walter Robb, and David Lannon. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
