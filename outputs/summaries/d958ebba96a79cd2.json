  "summary": "On May 23, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Minnesota entered a final judgment against a company that claimed to be the sole owner of 7,475 copyrighted works.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Las Vegas, Nevada, alleges that Your Inspiration at Home Pty Ltd. (\u201cYIAH\u201d) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  According to the complaint, YIAH also violated the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(3) of Exchange Act Rules 206(4)-8 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Adventure has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $8,369.50.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Western District of Nevada today announced criminal charges against Adventure.  To learn more about how to apply for a civil injunctive relief, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2019.  On May 24, 2020, the SEC filed a civil action against YiaH, charging it with violating the registration provision of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and with aiding and abetting Adventure's violations of Section 17(a)(2) of The Exchange Act and Rule 17a-3. The SEC is continuing its investigation, which is continuing to be conducted by the agency's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. The litigation will be led by A. C. Wright, A. Miller, and M. Kane. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Minnesota Office of the Attorney General, and the Federal Office of Financial Regulation."
