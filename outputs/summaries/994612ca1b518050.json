  "summary": "On December 17, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment finding that Counsel Financial II (CFII), a creditor to Jeffrey Lew Liddle, had a perfected security interest in the proceeds from the sale of Liddle's Fifth Avenue apartment, funds which the debtor had placed in escrow with his attorney before filing for bankruptcy. The court found that CFII did not have such an interest.  The court also found that Liddle and his attorney, Diane C. Nardone, were acting as escrow agents for CFII.  According to the court's order, CFII was acting as an agent for Liddle when Liddle filed for bankruptcy in 2016 and Liddle agreed to pay $5.6 million to settle the SEC's charges.  CFII's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, charges Liddle with violating Section 9-313 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against CFII, Liddle & Robinson, and its attorney, David Wander.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the SEC consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins CFII from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $5,622, which is equal to the amount Liddle has already paid to CFII as a relief defendant.  Liddle also agreed to be enjoined from future securities law violations, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to be restrained from issuing or selling any security-related documents.  Additionally, the court ordered CFII to post a $500,000 bond to cover damages incurred by Liddle in the event the court did not rule in his favor on the merits of the complaint.  On January 14, 2019 the court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered Liddle to hold the escrowed funds in an escrow account, pending decision on the motion for summary judgment and the order for an order of attachment.  As set forth in the Complaint, the Court found that the SEC had a right to determine whether to issue an order imposing an asset freeze or a cease-and-desist order, and that it had a duty to comply with the court order.  It also ordered the payment of civil penalties in the future.  For further information, see Litigation Release No."
