  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was found guilty of possession of methamphetamine, possession of a firearm by a felon, and habitual felon status.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that Brad Chatman Wirt was the driver of a beige Chevrolet pickup truck that was stopped by Randolph County Sheriff's Office officers on 6 January 2016 while driving to several hotels in the area.  According to the complaint, Wirt had been previously convicted for possession of marijuana and possession of diazepam, and was previously convicted of possession with intent to manufacture, sell or deliver a controlled substance.  Wirt's conviction was overturned on the basis of the jury's finding that he was not in exclusive possession of the illegal drugs.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the officers conducted a two-hour \u201crolling surveillance\u201d of the truck and found numerous bags and backpacks in the truck that contained numerous illegal drugs, including methamphetamine, marijuana, and a gun.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the officers used a K-9 unit to perform a \"free air sniff\" of the vehicle and found a revolver and holster beneath the driver's seat.  During the search, officers found a bag inside the truck containing thirty-nine pills, fifteen of which were later determined to be diazepams.   The complaint further alleges that Defendant was undisputedly the driver and had the power to control the contents of the car where the contraband was found, and that he made frequent stops at hotels, restaurants, and hotels, behavior commonly associated with drug activity.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2,500, and an officer-and-director bar against him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Additionally, the court ordered Wirt to surrender his passport and to be barred from associating with any person with whom he has a prior conviction for a felony or a prior felony conviction.  He also agreed to be restrained from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any firearm, and to a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from serving as an officer or director of a public company or participating in any sales of any security"
