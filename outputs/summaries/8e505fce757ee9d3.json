  "summary": "On June 3, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana entered a final judgment against a father who was ordered to relinquish his parental rights to his son, K.T. (\u201cChild\u201d).  The court found that the father violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Court also found that, contrary to the court's findings, the father failed to fully participate in all services and visitations offered by the court.  According to the Court's order, Father failed to participate fully in all visits with Child, despite repeated requests to do so, and failed to provide adequate childcare for the child while he was at work or at the Little League baseball games.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against the father.  On May 9, 2018, the court entered a temporary restraining order against Father, ordering him to participate in the Father Engagement Program, which is designed to protect the integrity of the natural relationship between parent and child.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar against him.  Separately, the Court issued an order suspending Father from participating in any court-ordered services or visitations for a period of nineteen months.  It also ordered him to comply with a court order requiring him to complete a two-step analysis to determine whether a reasonable probability exists that the termination is in the best interests of the child and that the child will be placed in the custody of the parent at the time of the termination.
