  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a Florida man who alleges that the federal government violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that, in violation of Section 1681 of the federal securities laws, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDOE) violated the bar for waiving sovereign immunity.  According to the complaint, the FBI violated this bar by failing to properly investigate and properly report delinquent debts to consumer reporting agencies.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Robinson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins the agency from violating the bar, and orders it to pay $10,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Robinson for his alleged role in the alleged violations.  On November 13, 2018, the court granted the SEC and PDOE a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering Robinson to pay a civil penalty of $20,000.  Robinson also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to a five-year officer-and-director bar, from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the public company or by participating in any offering of securities in connection with the issuance of any security or other security policy.  To settle the case, the Court granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered the SEC to comply with the court\u2019s order, and ordered the investigation to be conducted by the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations, with the assistance of the Florida Office of Financial Regulation and the Division of Enforcement.   The litigation will be led by C.J. Kerstetter and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Federal Office of Inspector General and the Florida Department of Banking and Securities and Insurance."
