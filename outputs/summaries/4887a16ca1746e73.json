  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Missouri announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against former research analyst Xinsheng Gan for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 36.380 of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Missouri, alleges that, in February 2013, the Department of Social Services (DFS) dismissed Mr. Gan from his position as research analyst for the department for various alleged misconduct on multiple occasions throughout his employment.  According to the complaint, while the department had cause to fire Gan for his alleged misconduct, it did not consider that he was singled out for criticism and scrutiny by his supervisors.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the department was not adequately trained in how to deal with such conduct, and that, as a result of his misconduct, he was not disciplined for his conduct.  Rather, the Commission found that, despite having been reprimanded for using the internet for personal reasons, he did not appear to be asleep at his desk in January 2013 when he claimed to be meditating.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, Gan agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains him from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an analyst for five years, and to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, other than for his own benefit.   The Commission's complaint charges Gan with violating Section 36,380, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  It also seeks an officer-and-director bar, a conduct-based injunction, and a penny stock bar against Gan. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the SEC's Office of Inspector General and the Division of Finance and Administrative Services, with the assistance of the Office of Compliance's Cyber Unit's Analysis and Detection Center, which uses data analysis tools to detect suspicious patterns of suspicious activity.  Among other things, the SEC has obtained an order requiring the SEC to conduct a two-tier review of the department's policies and procedures to determine whether there is reasonable cause to dismiss a person based on his or her race, and whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that he has violated the department\u2019s policies and practices.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-01-2017."
