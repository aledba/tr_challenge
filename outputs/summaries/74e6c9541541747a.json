  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on June 28, 2019 entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins Claiborne from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar.  The court also granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and a temporary asset freeze.  According to the court's order, filed on May 3, 2010, the defendant was shackled during a three-day trial on the basis that he was a convicted felon serving a lengthy prison sentence.  As alleged in the complaint, the shackling violated the right to a fair trial and the duty to maintain the dignity of the court.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Claiborn.  On June 24, 2019, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Court of Common Pleas entered a judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from violating the federal securities laws, ordering the defendants to disgorge their gains, and ordering the judge to appoint a new trial.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating these provisions, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the judgments.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221.  Separately, the SEC filed an amended complaint on June 26, 2019.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by David A. Deck and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Deck. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Criminal Justice, and the California Office of Inspector General."
