  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Oscar L. Clayborne in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Tazewell County, N.Y., charges Clayborne with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Clayborne.  According to the complaint, Clayborne pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to eight years and eight months of imprisonment.  On January 6, 2017, the court granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction, entered an emergency asset freeze, and issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering Clayborne to pay a civil penalty of $7,402. The court also issued an order suspending the asset freeze pending final approval by the court.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $8,724 in restitution, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The order also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of a law enforcement agency, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or any other federal agency. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 534, 567, 629 N.E.2d 724.  An SEC order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver will be instituted upon motion of the court upon motion by the SEC.  A hearing will be held on the matter at a later date to determine the appropriate amount of monetary relief to be provided to the receiver. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Joni Little. The case is being supervised by Amy S. Cotter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter, the United States Postal Inspection Service, and the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services."
