  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against a Mexican citizen who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, alleges that Mexican citizen Miguel Cano was arrested at the Mexican border on July 25, 2016. According to the complaint, Cano told the agents that he was going to Mexico to search for evidence of past or future border-related crimes. The complaint alleges that the agents searched Cano\u2019s phone and found 14.03 kilograms (30.93 pounds) of cocaine, which the complaint further alleges was a result of a routine, nonroutine search conducted at the border. The SEC also alleges that Cano had a history of drug-related convictions, including a felony conviction for possession of child pornography, and a prior conviction for drug-trafficking. The court also ruled that the warrantless searches violated the Fourth Amendment when they were conducted without reasonable suspicion or probable cause.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Cano. The case was investigated by the Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Los Angeles Field Office. The litigation will be led by John R. Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Mexican Attorney General's Office, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Mexican Secret Service in this matter."
