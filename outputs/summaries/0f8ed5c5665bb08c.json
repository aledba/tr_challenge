  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a parole violator for violating the terms and conditions of his release from prison.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, alleges that the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) improperly classified Raheen Johnson as a high risk sex offender subject to parole supervision.  According to the complaint, Johnson was released from prison on parole supervision on July 25, 2018, with a parole discharge date of July 24, 2021. The complaint alleges that Johnson violated the parole supervision provisions of Section 3000.08 of the federal parole supervision provision, which requires a court to determine whether a person should or should not be released from parole supervision, and that the court should not terminate parole when the defendant has already served 60 days under supervision. Johnson also allegedly failed to comply with CDCR's order to revoke his parole.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California today entered a final judgment against Johnson that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the mandatory minimum of 60 days of parole supervision and orders him to be placed on postrelease community supervision. The court will determine whether to revoke parole when it deems it necessary.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating these provisions, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties. The defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the parole provision.  To learn more about parole revocation, see the Prison Release Abuse Task Force's website.
