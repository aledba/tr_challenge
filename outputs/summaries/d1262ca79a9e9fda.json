  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a company that had filed for bankruptcy in the 1940s and 1950s.  The court found that the company had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that it was entitled to pre-confirmation of its claims.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in Manhattan, the company and its then-director of asbestos remediation, J.R. Grace, agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains the company from future violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 363(m) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 3003(c)(3) thereunder. The court also granted the company's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Grace, Grace, and Grace. The SEC's complaint charges Grace and Grace with violating the anti-fraud provision of the Exchange Act and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The Court granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction, entered an order requiring the company to restrout its assets and liabilities, and issued an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to discharge all of the company\u2019s claims in a timely fashion.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Grace and Grimes consented to final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 524(m).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
