  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered final judgments against a California mother and her three children in a prior juvenile dependency proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that, in October 2014, the California Department of Children and Family Services (CDFS) obtained an emergency court order to remove three children from their mother's custody.  According to the complaint, the order removed the children from mother's physical custody and ordered her to reside with a family friend who was not living with her at the time the order was issued.  In addition, the court ordered the mother to submit to seven drug tests between November 18, 2014 and February 27, 2015, which were conducted by the agency's Office of Inspector General, with the assistance of a Department of Justice social worker.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, mother failed to comply with the court's order, and was placed temporarily in the hospital with a broken arm.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court order, mother consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Rebecca L. Gibson of the United States District Court in the Southern District of New York entered final judgment against the defendant, permanently enjoining her from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering her to return to the custody of her children, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against her. The court also issued an order requiring mother to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court, which is subject to court approval. The order also requires the court to consider whether to remove the other children from the parent's custody at the relevant time.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 29, 2014)."
