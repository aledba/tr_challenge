  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas today entered a final judgment against a former information technology supervisor for Fort Bend County, Texas, for failing to exhaust her administrative remedies.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Dallas, alleges that Lois Davis, a former employee of Fort Bend's Human Resources Department, filed a complaint with the agency alleging that the information technology director had sexually harassed and assaulted her. The complaint alleged that Davis failed to exhaust all of her administrative duties and that she was entitled to a right-to-sue letter from the agency.  Davis also alleged that the complaint was not jurisdictional and that the agency had no jurisdiction over her.  According to the complaint, Davis was unable to work one specific Sunday because she had a \"previous religious commitment\" to attend a special church service, and her supervisor did not approve the absence.  In its judgment, the court held that Davis had failed to complete all of the administrative remedies required by the federal law, and that Davis was entitled, without admitting or denying the allegations, to a court-ordered injunction and a right to a preliminary injunction. The court also ruled that Davis could not file a complaint in federal court because of the jurisdictional requirements under the federal statute.  Without admitting to the SEC's findings, Davis consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For additional information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.

On June 9, 2018, the Court granted a temporary restraining order and issued an order requiring Fort Bend to comply with the court's order.  A hearing is scheduled for July 13, 2019, for which the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
