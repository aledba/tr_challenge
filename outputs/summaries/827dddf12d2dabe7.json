  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Shirley Lyle, her sister, Katherine Lyle Harbison, and her brother, James Waller Lyle Hitt.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson County, Arkansas, alleges that Shirley violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Shirley filed a third amended complaint in December 2010 alleging that the court improperly denied her and James\u2019 requests for attorney\u2019s fees and other relief based on a finding that the parties had a long-established routine of lax accounting practices that made it virtually impossible to accurately determine whether there had been any profits.  In addition, the complaint alleges that James and Katherine sought to have Shirley be held in contempt for her conduct during the pendency of the litigation.  Shirley also claimed that the defendants deeded the farm property to Katherine with the understanding that each of the partners would receive a deed for the land as part of the partnership.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of $175,157.40 plus prejudgment interest of $1,038.40, a civil monetary penalty of $75,000, and a penny stock bar against Shirley.  On May 9, 2007, the court granted the defendants a temporary restraining order and ordered the parties to comply with the court order.  As a result of the court-ordered injunction, Shirley and James filed a second amended complaint on April 13, 2017, seeking to have the court enjoin them from future violations of the anti-fraud provision of Section 16-22-308 of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000. The court also denied the defendants\u2019 motion for an accounting and ordered a hearing on June 30, 2018, to determine whether or not to issue an order permanently enjoining Shirley from violating these provisions, ordering her to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $150,000; ordering the defendants to pay an accounting in accordance with the agreed-upon amount of the settlement; ordering Shirley to pay interest in a separate civil monetary case; and ordering the receivership of Sink Farm, which is subject to court approval. The defendants agreed to settle the case without admitting, denying, or denying their requests for, any monetary penalty"
