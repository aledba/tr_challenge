  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Wilber Ulises Molina, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 55 years in prison.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, alleges that Molina violated his constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him by allowing an analyst to testify based on DNA testing that was performed by others at an out-of-state laboratory.  According to the complaint, Molina agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Molina also agreed to be barred from appearing before the SEC as an expert in the case.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against Molina.  Among other things, the SEC's investigation was conducted by George Sensabaugh, David H. Kaye, and George W. McCluskey, and was supervised by Gregory A. Kasper. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Houston Police Department, and the Houston Field Office in this matter."
