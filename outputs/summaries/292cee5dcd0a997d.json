  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the SEC against the defendants.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, in May 2011, Patrick J. Katz, an orthopedic physician, surreptitiously videotaped an independent medical examination conducted by an outside consultant for a New York-based construction company.  According to the complaint, Dr. Katz agreed to the recording without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, and agreed to pay $10,000.00 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants agreed to be barred from appearing in court as a witness in the future because of the nature of the evidence presented in the Complaint.  As alleged, the defendants also failed to disclose to defense counsel that they had obtained a recording of the second IME of the plaintiff, which was conducted by a non-practicing doctor, and that the recording was recorded by a third physician retained by the defendants, who was not present at the time of the examination.   The complaint charges Katz with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar against Katz.  On May 24, 2013, the Honorable Judge Robert A. Hannan of the U.N. Division of Justice in Manhattan granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order, ordered Katz to surrender his passport, and ordered Hannan to return to the United States.  Hannan consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $20,000 civil penalty, and orders him not to participate in future court proceedings, including in the selection of a jury for the first time in a federal criminal case, and requires him to provide a copy of the SEC Complaint to the court as part of an ongoing investigation. The SEC also ordered that Hannan comply with the court's order, including by providing an accounting of the alleged misconduct of the trial attorney, and by appointing a receiver to oversee the investigation.\u00c2\u00a0 Hannan and Hannan agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the issuance of a court order that requires each of them to produce a video recording of a medical examination in the course of which the court will determine whether to impose a penalty. The court also granted Hannan's request for a hearing"
