  "summary": "On March 26, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina entered a final judgment against the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Attorney General (collectively the \u201cGovernment\u201d) in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that the debt-collection exemption to the automated call ban is facially unconstitutional under the Free Speech Clause of the federal securities laws. The complaint also alleges that, as a result of congressional concern with intrusive and intrusive phone calls, many of the calls were made to cell phones that use \"any automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice.\" According to the complaint, these calls are among the most intrusive, disruptive, and complained of phone calls made to American consumers. In a parallel action, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DOH) today announced criminal charges against the defendants. The SEC also announced that it had obtained an emergency court order temporarily freezing the assets of the defendants and ordering an asset freeze and other emergency relief. The court's order temporarily froze assets frozen by the defendants, and the SEC's investigation was conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Cyber Unit. The litigation will be led by John Rymas. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Public Finance Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter."
