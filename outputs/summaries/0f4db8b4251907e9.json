  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Joshua Martin Miracle, Jr., who was charged with orchestrating a double-murder and attempted capital murder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Santa Barbara, California on October 2, 2004, defendant and his attorney, Trevor C. Allen, agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty.  The court also ordered that defendant and Ibarra consented to be enjoined from violating Section 1018 of the Exchange Act, which prohibits defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related material, including the right to self-representation in a capital case.  In addition, the court ordered defendant to comply with a court order requiring him to consent to a guilty plea and to cooperate with an independent counsel.  On October 4, 2005, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against defendant, charging him with violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-2 and Rule 15a-3 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendant consented, on a joint and several basis, to entry of the judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of the United States District Judge in San Diego and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the California Department of Criminal Justice, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
