  "summary": "On June 19, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Maryland entered a final judgment against a Maryland-based company and its former CEO in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Maryland, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, and the court granted the defendants a temporary restraining order and ordered the parties to jointly pay $12,000.00 per month for a period of thirty months. The court also granted the parties the right to jointly-pay $14,457.19 per year for a six-month period ending June 20, 2018.  In its judgment, the court found that the parties violated Section 11-106 of the Exchange Act and Rules 12-103(a) and 12-104(c) thereunder, and that the court violated Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 12-105 thereunder and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder; and that it violated Section 17(a)(1) of The Exchange Act.  It also ordered the defendants to jointly and severally pay $1,514,270 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their jointly-paid alimony in the case.   The court agreed to the parties\u2019 joint-payments and to the payment of civil penalties equal to their respective amounts of alimony.  Without admitting or denied the SEC\u2019s findings, the parties consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions, ordering them to pay civil penalties of $1.5 million each, and ordering the parties not to exceed $20,000 per month in pre-judgment interest. The final judgments also order the parties jointly to pay a civil monetary penalty of $2 million each.  On August 2, 2019, the SEC filed an amended complaint against the defendants, seeking a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 12-106, and an order appointing a receiver to determine the amount and duration of any future alimony awards to be determined by the court upon motion of the parties.  Among other things, the complaint alleges that, in a parallel action, the Maryland Attorney General's Office today announced that it has obtained a court order to freeze the assets of the defendants and to conduct an independent investigation into the alleged misconduct. The SEC also issued an order freezing the assets"
