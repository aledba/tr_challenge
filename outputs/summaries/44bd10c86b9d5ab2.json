  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the California Department of Environmental Quality (CEQA) for failing to adequately evaluate the impact of neonicotinoid pesticides on honey bees.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, alleges that the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DOE) failed to adequately assess the potential adverse environmental impacts of certain pesticides, including dinotefuran 20SG and Venom Insecticide. The complaint further alleges that, as a result of the DOE's failure to conduct a fair and reasonable review of the pesticides, the Department's final decision to approve the pesticides was effectively meaningless.  In its final judgment, the court found that the DOE violated the federal antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also ordered the DOE to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court.  According to the SEC's order, the DOE failed to properly evaluate the potential impact of the proposed pesticides on bees and other pollinators, including honey bees, and failed to provide any reasonable explanation for why the DOE had not reviewed the potential impacts of the new pesticides.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the department has agreed to a permanent injunction, to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Secretary of State's Office, the California Office of Environmental Education, and the California Division of Forestry and Fire Protection."
