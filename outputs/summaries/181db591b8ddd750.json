  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio today entered final judgments against AirNet Systems, Inc. (\"AirNet\") and Thomas Schaner (\"Schaner\") in an employment discrimination action brought by AirNet's former CEO, Dan W. Vossman.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Columbus, Ohio, on June 15, 2011, AirNet filed a complaint alleging that a co-worker complained about his unsafe flying practices on two flights and accused him of violating the company's policies and procedures.  The court found that, contrary to what the complaint alleged, Airnet had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating the employee.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the complaint was false and misleading, and the co-workers and other AirNet employees were not treated equally under similar circumstances.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action, charging AirNet with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering AirNet to pay $45,714.53 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  On March 26, 2014, the court granted summary judgment in favor of AirNet, ordering the company to pay a $75,000 civil penalty and ordering the airline to pay an $8,500 civil penalty in a related administrative proceeding.  AirNet agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that imposes permanent injunctions, prohibits the company from issuing or selling any security, and provides for the appointment of a receiver to determine the appropriate amount of attorney fees to be paid to the receiver.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson, Russell A. Kelm, and Joanne Detrick of the Public Finance Abuse Unit in the Atlanta Regional Office, with the assistance of the Ohio Office of Compliance's Office of Inspector General and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The litigation will be led by Messrs Gibson, Gibson, and Gittes. The case is being supervised by Amy Blackburn, Mike Troy, and John Deere. The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the FBI, the Ohio Attorney General's Office, the Internal Revenue Service, the U."
