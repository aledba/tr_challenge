  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Rochester, New York, alleges that New York State Trooper Peter Ferguson conducted a traffic stop on August 2, 2018, in the City of Rochester, because the windows of a black Toyota Venza appeared to have less than 70% transparency in violation of federal law. According to the complaint, the Venza was being used by a probation officer to steal drugs out of a rental property that he owned on Norton Avenue. The complaint alleges that Defendant was acting in a belligerent and uncooperative manner and was being restrained by another probation officer. The SEC alleges that Officer Bedette, who was supervising the conduct of the traffic stop, was not restrained by the probation officer and did not participate in the search. Instead, the complaint alleges, he was restrained and placed in the back of the vehicle by Bedette. The court entered a temporary restraining order against the defendant and ordered Bedette to comply with the court's order. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the felon.  In a related administrative proceeding, the Department of Justice announced that it had obtained an asset freeze and other emergency relief. The investigation was conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Rochester Police Department, and the Rochester Office of Inspector General in this matter."
