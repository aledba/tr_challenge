  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Alpha Capital Anstalt, Inc., a California-based company that has agreed to pay $500,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Alpha violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to honor its obligations under the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Alpha also failed to show sufficient evidence to show that it had breached its obligations as a shareholder and that it would suffer irreparable harm if it did not honor the conversion requests.  In addition, Alpha's complaint alleges that it failed to demonstrate that it could not afford to pay the conversion costs and that its stock price was unsustainable.  Alpha's motion for summary judgment, which is subject to court approval, seeks a permanent injunction, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar against Alpha.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Alpha has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders Alpha to pay disgorgements of $1,266,667, plus interest of $2,038, and orders Alpha's payment of a civil monetary penalty of $250,000.   The court also granted Alpha's request for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the securities registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4), and issued an order requiring Alpha to provide a copy of the complaint to the court.  On June 20, 2019, the court granted Alpha a temporary restraining order and ordered Alpha to comply with the court's order, ordering Alpha to deliver one million shares of its common stock, and to pay a $100,000 civil penalty in the amount of $500.  It also granted the company's request to have the court issue an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver's receiver.  Finally, on October 4, 2019 Alpha filed an amended complaint with the SEC alleging that it has breached the obligations under Section 206 of the Act and that the receiver has failed to honor the request.  As alleged in the amended complaint, however, the SEC found that Alpha had not demonstrated sufficient evidence of breach of contract to warrant a temporary injunction, and that Alpha has not acted as a reasonable broker-dealer in recovering investor funds from the alleged fraud.  Additionally, the complaint alleged that Alpha failed to provide any reasonable explanation for why the receiver had not received the receiver"
