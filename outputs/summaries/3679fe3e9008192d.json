  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wyoming today entered a final judgment in favor of a Wyoming company employee who was not entitled to TTD benefits because he had reached maximum medical improvement (MMI).  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on June 26, 2012, Troy Coggins injured his right leg while working as a truck driver for Mullinax Concrete Services. The complaint alleges that the company's management improperly relied upon the fact that the injured employee had reached MMI and was unlikely to benefit from a spinal cord stimulator to determine whether he was at MMI.  The complaint further alleges that, in May 2016, Dr. Ulibarri performed an L5-S1 discectomy on the injured individual, and he received a TTD benefit on August 15, 2016.  In a written opinion, the court found that, contrary to the representations made in the complaint, Mr. Coggin had reached the MMI threshold and was not at risk of being terminated. The court also ruled that, as a result of this finding, the company was entitled to a permanent partial disability (TTD) benefit based on the condition of the individual.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the OAH's judgment, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Denver Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Morris. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Wyoming Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Wyoming Office of Inspector General, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Wyo., and the Wyoming State Office of Insurance Regulation."
