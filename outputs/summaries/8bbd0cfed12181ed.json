  "summary": "On November 5, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Steven Fishoff, a former trader at Featherwood Capital, Inc., that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that Fishoff began trading securities in the early 1990s when he was a skilled trader and eventually quit his job in the clothing manufacturing sector to trade full-time. According to the complaint, Fishoff initially traded in partnership with a \"backer,\" i.e., an investor who provided the capital for his trading activity. The complaint alleges that thebacker was silent in the face of Fishoff\u2019s affirmative defense in September 2013, when the SEC brought a case against 23 individuals based on that rule. The SEC previously charged Fishoff with insider trading based on this information.  Fishoff agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Fishoff.  On November 6, the court issued a written order ordering Fishoff to comply with the SEC's order, which requires him to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he did not know the substance of the non-imprisonment defense.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint Fishoff consented to a judgment imposing permanent injunctions, ordering him to disgorge $1.5 million in ill-gotten gains plus interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar. Fishoff also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The court also ordered him to provide a copy of the Pre-Sentence Report, which was prepared by Fishoff and reviewed by staff at the SEC.  To learn more about insider trading, see Investor.gov.
