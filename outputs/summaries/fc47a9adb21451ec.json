  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of New Hampshire today entered a final judgment against New Hampshire Insurance Company (NIC) against Neisinger, who was injured in the course of his employment when a high-pressure stream of water hit his left thigh and knocked him off a platform.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against New England, which ordered NIC to conduct a medical examination and provide treatment to a worker with a history of anxiety and insomnia.  According to the SEC's order, NIC improperly scheduled a psychiatric exam before it knew if he had a psychological condition related to his work-related injury and failed to provide a reasonable basis for requiring a second exam.  In its order, the court found that NIC violated Section 39-71-605 of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that New Hampshire was liable for NIC\u2019s liability for the alleged injury.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, New Hampshire consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins NIC from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay for a psychiatric examination and treatment of a worker who has had an injury or disability. The final judgment also orders NIC not to require an examination with a psychiatrist or psychologist before it can obtain a \u00a7 605 exam. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  On May 27, 2015, Neisingers was injured and required to see a psychiatrist and psychologist before he was able to obtain a medical exam. On August 18, 2016, after receiving a referral from a pain specialist who recommended a psychologist/psychiatrist referral, N.H. issued an order requiring NIC and its insurer to obtain an examination and to provide treatment if necessary. On October 26, 2017, after recovering from a leg surgery, Neizinger returned to Dr. Elliot and reported an increase in left knee pain. The WIC's order requires NIC, its insurer, and its employee to submit to medical examinations and treatment. The order also requires that NNH first pay for an evaluation and treatment, including a diagnostic update of his condition. The complaint alleges that the WIC improperly delayed NIC's decision on whether to require a second examination until after it had first authorized and paid for the third. The court's order also prohibits NNH from requiring a third-party physician or psychologist to evaluate a claimant. The Commission's order against NIC also requires NNH to provide an independent evaluation of the claimant."
