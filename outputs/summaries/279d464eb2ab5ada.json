  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment in favor of the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services against a healthcare provider who filed for bankruptcy.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, Elena Hernandez filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition in December 2016, claiming that she owed significant sums to three healthcare providers who treated her work-related injuries.  The complaint alleges that, in her bankruptcy petition, Hernandez claimed an exemption for the entirety of that claim, citing a provision that requires providers to pay a certain percentage of workers\u2019 compensation benefits to their employees.  As alleged in the complaint, however, this exemption was not sufficient to cover her claims.  Instead, the complaint alleges, she claimed that the exemption was necessary to enable her to reach her settlement.  In a parallel action, the Illinois Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Hernandez arising from the same conduct.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Hernandez consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay $28,709.60 to Ambulatory Surgical Care Facility, Marque Medicos Fullerton LLC, and Medicos Pain and Surgical Specialists, S.C., tolling the statute of limitations during payment disputes to prevent her from reaching a settlement with her employer.  Additionally, the court ruled that the amount of her owed settlement would be determined by the court at a later date.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
