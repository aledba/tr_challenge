  "summary": "On January 12, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment in favor of the medical marijuana industry.  According to the court's order, on May 17, 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH) and Permittees submitted applications for medical marijuana licenses and dispensary permits.  The court found that none of the applicants met their obligations under the federal securities laws, including the right to privacy, to disclose certain security-related redactions, and the duty of disclosure to the government.  In its order, the court also found that DOH violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that all of the applications were subject to the same redactions.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, DOH, Mission, and KW Ventures consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the above-mentioned provisions, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, offer and sale of any medical marijuana product, including, without limitation, medical marijuana plants and medical marijuana products.  DOH also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Additionally, the Court granted a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against all three applicants.  On January 24, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against DOH and Mission, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against each of them.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office in this matter."
