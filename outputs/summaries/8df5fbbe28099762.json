  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin today entered a final judgment against the Pension Board of Wisconsin against the agency.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Susan A. Baldwin was an employee of Milwaukee County who was not eligible to receive pension benefits.  The complaint alleges that, in October 2003, the pension board made a decision that, pursuant to Rule 1001, Baldwin was not entitled to purchase service credits for prior, non-continuous years of service.  As alleged in the complaint, this decision affected the pension Board's 2003 determination of the amount of Baldwin's monthly pension payment.  In addition, as alleged, Baldwin had received overpayments in her 1969 short-term employment with the County of Milwaukee, and that decision was not final.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Baldwin consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $223,000.  On March 31, 2015, the Wisconsin Department of Justice filed a civil injunctive action against Baldwin, charging her with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Wisconsin Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Wisconsin Office of Inspector General."
