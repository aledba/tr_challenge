  "summary": "On March 8, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered summary judgment against Stratos Elevator, Inc., a Louisiana-based elevator maintenance company, and its insurance company, StarNet Insurance Company (collectively, \"Stratos\").  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on October 9, 2013, in federal court in New Orleans, Stratos and StarNet violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by not performing proper maintenance and/or maintaining preventative maintenance on the elevators at Earl K. Long Medical Center.  The complaint alleges that, on October 10, 2012, the elevator dropped and then abruptly went up as she exited, causing her to be violently flung into the adjacent wall, causing serious injury.  As alleged in the complaint, in 2010 Stratos executed an Elevator Maintenance and Repair Contract with EKL that required it to perform routine maintenance and repair of elevators.  In its capacity as the workers' compensation insurer that paid Ms. Bowen benefits as a result of the accident, the complaint alleged that Stratos failed to preserve evidence, including the affidavits of two experts, and that it failed to timely respond to the requests for summary judgment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the United States District Court, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $25,000.  Finally, the court granted the motion for summary judgement on March 21, 2017.  On May 22, 2016, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Stratos, finding that it was negligent in failing to comply with the Commission's order requiring it to provide timely and reasonable assistance in determining whether or not there is a genuine issue of material fact with respect to elevators located on the premises.  Additionally, the Commission ordered Stratos to provide the last known address of any person who was injured in the elevator, and to provide a copy of the elevator service request log to the Commission as part of its investigation.  It also ordered that the Commission provide a fair opportunity to present its findings to the court in a timely and appropriate manner.   The Commission also ordered the Commission to provide an accounting of its findings in its order granting summary judgment, which is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the New Orleans Regional Office."
