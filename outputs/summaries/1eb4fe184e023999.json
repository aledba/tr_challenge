  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska today entered a final judgment in favor of a South Carolina-based wrestling coach who was found liable for more than $95,000 in damages for injuries he sustained in a slip-and-fall accident.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Omaha, Nebraska, alleges that, on March 10, 2010, Kelly was in Omaha for a wrestling tournament and went to eat dinner at Burger Star Restaurant, which was owned and operated by Cutch, Inc., and Cutchall Management Company, Inc.  According to the complaint, Kelly fell in the shower and injured his left knee and back. The complaint alleges that Kelly had no significant health problems prior to his fall, including no history of pain, injury, or limitation with his right knee or back, and that he was able to move up and down stairs without any pain or limitation prior to the fall.  Kelly also allegedly experienced sharp, shooting pain in his lower back as well as pain, weakness, and instability in his left leg.  In September 2010, the court granted the SEC's request for a jury instruction on the aggravation of a preexisting condition, but refused to give the jury an instruction on how to determine whether to award damages based on the evidence presented at trial.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s order, Kelly consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a $100,000 civil penalty. The court also ordered Kelly to pay a $75,000 penalty, which is subject to court approval.  On the same day, Kelly pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud and was sentenced to five years of probation. The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
