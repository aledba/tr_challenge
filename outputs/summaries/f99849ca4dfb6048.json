  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia today entered a final judgment in favor of the wife of a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for orchestrating a fraudulent scheme to steal millions of dollars from his wife.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Virginia, on June 3, 2006, Raymond H. and his wife, Cammie H. (the wife), purchased three properties in Virginia that were subject to equitable distribution pursuant to W. Va. Code \u00a7 43-1-2(a) and (c). The complaint alleges that the wife did not give notice to the husband of the deeds of trust and instead used the property as collateral for the loans. The complaint further alleges that, in the event of a subsequent divorce, the value of the real estate conveyed by the properties would be substantially less than the fair market value.

Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, the husband consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering him to pay disgorgement of $450,000 plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and ordering the payment of civil penalties of $100,000 each.   The court also ordered the husband to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, which was determined by the court upon the motion of the family court, and ordered him to disgorge $150,000 in ill-gotten gains plus interest, and pay a $20,000 penalty.  Finally, the judge granted the wife's request for a temporary restraining order against further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 10(b) of the"
