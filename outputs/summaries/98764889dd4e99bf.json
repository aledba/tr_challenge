  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on July 21, 2014, the hospital suspended a physician who had complained about patient safety at the facility.  The complaint alleges that the hospital terminated the physician's medical staff privileges on July 11, 2011, after he failed to show a reasonable probability of success on the merits of his claims.  As alleged in the complaint, the suspension resulted in a permanent injunction against the hospital from future violations of the federal securities laws, as well as a temporary restraining order preventing him from participating in the peer review process.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Cedars agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins the suspension from further violations of Section 1278.5 of the Exchange Act, and orders the hospital to pay a civil penalty of $25,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the physician.   The SEC also issued an order suspending the physician from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an expert witness in a peer review case.  On August 29, 2011 the SEC filed an emergency action against the medical staff of the hospital, suspending him from appearing and practicing before a SEC peer review committee.  This action, which is continuing, is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov website to quickly and easily identify whether they are registered professionals.  For example, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the California Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
