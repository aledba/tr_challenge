  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas yesterday entered a final judgment against a Llano, Texas officer who was charged with making a false entry into a home for the purpose of making an arrest.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Llano on June 10, 2018, Chief of Police Kevin Ratliff was the chief of police for the City of Llano when he was arrested on May 9, 2004. According to his complaint, Ratliffe was the Chief of the Department of Public Safety when he made the arrest and was confronted by two officers who demanded that he enter the home and arrest Nutt. The complaint alleges that the officers entered the home without a warrant and instead followed Nutt's instructions to \"get out of the trailer.\" The complaint further alleges that Officer Harden confronted Nutt and told him that he was going to arrest him for public intoxication and that he would be going to jail if he did not comply with the officers' orders to leave the home. The SEC alleges that this conduct violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) of Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17a-3 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The final judgment orders Ratlief to pay disgorgement of $7,500 plus prejudgment interest of $1,500, and orders him not to participate in the issuance, purchase, offer, or offer of any securities in the future. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Fort Worth Regional Office, and is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Mr. Barry and Ms. Barry, and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The case has been supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Eric R. Werner of the San Antonio Regional Office and was supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The trial will be conducted by Kathryn A. McKinley and Mr. Werner under the supervision of John R. Burt of the Texas Office of Inspector General. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Texas Commodity Futures Trading Commission in this matter."
