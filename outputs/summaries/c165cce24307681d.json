  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Victor Coley in a jury trial that was conducted in open court.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Coley violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Coley consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. The SEC alleges that the jury deliberated until 12:05 p.m. on February 20, 2015, when the court received a note from a jury member informing the jury that it had reached a unanimous verdict on all of the charges against Coley. The judge then instructed the jury to continue deliberating until the last possible moment of the juror's statement, which indicated that she did not agree with the jury's decision. The jury then deliberated for an hour and a half, with the judge not participating in the deliberation. The final judgment, which was enjoined by the court, ordered Coley to comply with the court's order and ordered him to be restrained from participating in any conduct that could result in a coerced verdict. The court also ordered the jury not to question the impartiality of the jury.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Mr. Coley, who was also charged in the same criminal case, charging Coley with violating Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b)(5) and (c) thereunder, and ordered the trial judge to provide an accounting of the number of votes that were cast on the jury based on the information contained in the note. The judgment also imposed a penalty of $75,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a $50,000 officer-and-director bar.   The court's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Ms. Burt of the New York Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New Jersey Office of Inspector General in this matter."
