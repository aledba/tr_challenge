  "summary": "On February 8, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana entered a final judgment against GmbH, a German company that manufactures polypropylene water pipes.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, alleges that, from January 2011 through December 2015, Gmbh sold its product (completed pipe) to an Indiana-based manufacturer, Aquatherm, L.P. (Aquatherm), for the purpose of replacing the galvanized steel supply lines in the Towers.  According to the complaint, the manufacturer's warranty required that, in the event of a material failure, it would work \"in collaboration with a manufacturer that has absolutely no physical presence in the United States.\"  In addition, the complaint alleges that the manufacturer did not have any sales or marketing representatives or distribution networks in Indiana, and that it did not \"actively engage in the manufacture, marketing, sales and/or supplying of the products\" as required by the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's order granting the motion for summary judgment, the court agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties of $413,300.  In a parallel action, on February 9, 2020, a federal district court in Chicago issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendants' assets, and ordering them to pay a civil penalty of $50,000.  On February 13, 2020 the court granted the request for a preliminary injunction, and ordered the companies to provide a copy of the order to the court for further determination by the court upon motion by the SEC.   The court also granted the companies' request for an asset freeze and a cease-and-desist order, ordering the companies and their associated entities to jointly and severally comply with the court's order. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Indiana Department of Commerce, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Indianapolis Office of Financial Regulation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Ohio Department of Insurance, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services, the FBI's Retail Strategy Task Force, the United Kingdom Department of Justice's Office of Economic and Risk Analysis, the Department of Homeland Security"
