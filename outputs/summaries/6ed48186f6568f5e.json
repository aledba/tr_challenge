  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments in a civil action brought by the Civans against Windermere Farms, Inc. (Windermere) and Gambone Brothers Development Company (Gambone) in connection with alleged faulty construction of a new home sold by both of them pursuant to an agreement of sale.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia on December 5, 2006, Gambone and Windermere violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to demonstrate that they had a valid agreement to arbitrate and that Gambone was not a party to the agreement.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants also failed to show that the arbitration panel had jurisdiction over Gambone.  In its judgment, the court found that the parties violated the federal securities laws and that the arbitrators had the power to determine whether a party was entitled to an arbitration award based upon the facts of the case.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's opinion, the Commission agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the charged provisions and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $192,768.  It also ordered the defendants to submit to arbitration a judgment that would permanently enjoin them from future violations of the charged sections of the Exchange Act.   The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Timothy J. Burt. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Philadelphia Office of Financial Regulation, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling them investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against one of the defendants.
