  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a medical malpractice action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, alleges that defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to provide sufficient evidence to show that an injury or serious injury was caused by participation in a clinical trial.  According to the complaint, defendants failed to adequately disclose that their injuries were consistent with those experienced by extremely low birth-weight infants.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants' medical providers failed to inform them of the risks associated with participation in the clinical study.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, defendants' negligence, negligence per se, breach of fiduciary duty, and products liability provisions of the federal securities laws apply to informed consent claims.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their ill-gotten gains plus interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar against each defendant.

Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against defendants for their roles in the alleged misconduct.  Among other things, the SEC also issued an order requiring the defendants to provide proof of any injury that occurred in performing a medical procedure, including a post-operative wound or requiring the amputation of a significant portion of a foot.  For further information, see SEC Litigation Release No: 567, 533 (Sept. 6, 2017).  The complaint also names as a relief defendant a Texas-based company, Masimo Corporation, which manufactures specialized oximeters that detect and record the presence of an injury when a patient is exposed to a potentially harmful substance.  Masimo has agreed to a settlement where it will be permanently enjoined from violating the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (c) of"
