  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland today entered a final judgment against a Maryland man who was convicted of two counts of witness tampering and obstruction of justice in a sham marriage.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore on January 18, 2018, Darrayl Wilson, a convicted felon, was sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment, three-and-a-half years of supervised release, and a three-year bar from appearing as a witness in a criminal proceeding.  The SEC alleges that Wilson engaged in numerous telephone conversations with various individuals discussing his intention to marry Ms. Bannister before the trial judge could compel him to testify in their respective murder trials.  In one instance, the complaint alleges that the two married just a week before they were scheduled to marry, and after the trial court found that Wilson was competent and compellable to give evidence for or against his wife, he was unable to invoke the spousal privilege.  As alleged in the complaint, Wilson was not competent to testify as an adverse witness in his own murder trial, and his wife was not a competent witness in her own defense.    The court's final judgment, which permanently enjoins Wilson from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Wilson consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against him.  He also agreed to be barred from appearing in criminal proceedings as a spouse of a person convicted of a felony, and to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the purchase, sale, offer or offer of any security, including the right to reapply after five years of imprisonment.  Finally, the court agreed to a permanent bar prohibiting Wilson from appearing or practicing before it as a judge in any criminal proceeding, including in the case of his own criminal trial.  It also ruled that Wilson could not be compelled to testify against him in the future because he was an \"obstructionist.\"  The final judgment also prohibits Wilson from acting as an unregistered broker or representative of a state or federal agency, and prohibits him from associating with anyone who is not a registered broker or dealer of securities.
