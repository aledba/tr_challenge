  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against a Hampton Township Police Officer for his role in a 2015 motor vehicle accident that left James Scott Stivenson seriously injured.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Michigan, alleges that Hampton Township Officer Bryan Benchley made material misstatements and omissions in his affidavit in support of a search warrant for a vehicle that caused serious impairment of a body function. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Benchley failed to tell the jury that he had taken a pill to help him \u201crelax\u201d and that he drove a car that struck a pedestrian. The complaint further alleges that the defendant had consumed some beer, that he was speeding through the intersection, and that, after the accident, he tried to rush across the street in front of defendant\u2019s car. The SEC alleges that Judge Kelly did not follow the instructions given to him, and instead relied on the false and misleading statements contained in the affidavit.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Benchley.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Benchley consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $500,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 596, 605, 822 N.W.2d 535 (2008).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Riddle of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Department of Justice, and the Federal Office of Inspector General."
