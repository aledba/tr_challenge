  "summary": "On March 28, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against Monroe Land Investments, LLC, a Philadelphia-area real estate developer, for denying a special exception to a proposed Dunkin' Donuts restaurant.  The court entered the final judgment in favor of Monroe, which permanently enjoins the company from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 14(e) of the Philadelphia Zoning Code, and orders the company to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1.2 million.  In its order, the court also granted the company's request for a temporary restraining order against future violations of the federal securities laws.  According to the court's order, Monroe failed to meet its burden of proof in denying the application because there was insufficient evidence to support the ZBA's conclusion that the project was substantially likely to cause a significant impact on the neighborhood beyond what is normally expected from a take-out restaurant on that site.  On March 26, 2018, the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia entered an order against Monroe, permanently enjoining it from violating Section 14e of the Market Abuse and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the city to issue an emergency asset freeze and other emergency relief.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, Monroe agreed to a permanent injunction and to the entry and exit of the proposed restaurant without violating the pre-clearance provisions of Sections 14e-3 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 12b-20 thereunder.  It also agreed to the appointment of a receiver for the District of Philadelphia, which will determine whether to issue a permit for the restaurant based on the merits of the case.
