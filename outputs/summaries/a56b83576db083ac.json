  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Wayne A. G. James, Jr., a former senator from the Virgin Islands, for wire fraud and embezzlement.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that James violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC also charged James with wire fraud in violation of Rule 13a-14.  According to the complaint, James used a large portion of the checks issued to him for his personal expenses, including for his re-election campaign.  James also alleges that the District Court improperly permitted the use of a chart as a demonstrative aid to accompany the case agent\u2019s testimony, and that the chart was inadmissible because it was used to show that James had an ongoing scheme to steal taxpayer money.  In a parallel action, on October 1, 2015, a federal district court in Manhattan returned an indictment charging James with two counts of wire fraud, one of which was filed in October 2015, and the other in January 2016.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, James consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On October 2, 2016, the court granted James a temporary restraining order and ordered him to return to the district court for a hearing scheduled for September 30, 2017.  As part of the settlement, James agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, to a five-year officer-and-director bar, and to a three-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, including securities in exchange for a share of the proceeds of a federal securities law enforcement action.  To settle the case, James also agreed to a six-year bar, with the right to reapply after five years, to the appointment of a trial judge, to participate in the selection of a jury, to receive a copy of the final judgment, to be followed by an examination of the jury record, to determine whether there is sufficient evidence for a jury selection, to consider the merits of the case against James.  Finally, the Court granted James the right, after a lengthy deliberation, to return a jury-ordered $18,000 bond in an eviction case"
