  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Gray, Louisiana man accused of home improvement fraud.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in New Orleans, Don Peter Hebert was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that Hebert entered into two separate contracts with the defendant and his fencing company, TNT Fencing, in which Hebert agreed to construct a cyclone fence around his residence. The complaint further alleges that the defendant agreed to pay $2,700.00 of the $3,000.00 down payment in the first contract and to be reimbursed for the work in the second contract.  Hebert also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendant did not perform any work under the contract and instead hired a different contractor to do the work.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Hebert consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of five years imprisonment at hard labor.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Louisiana today entered a judgment against Hebert, permanently enjoining him from violating Section 14:202.1 of the Exchange Act and Rule 12b-20 thereunder, and ordering the defendant to pay disgorgement of $4,700, which is equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,500, and a civil monetary penalty of two years imprisonment.  On May 30, 2014, the trial court granted the defendant's motion for a new trial and ordered that the jury consider the merits of the case.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Orleans Office of Inspector General, and the Louisiana Department of State Office of Criminal Investigations."
