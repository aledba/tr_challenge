  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Vernon Parish man accused of strangling and suffocating his wife.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, on September 21, 2016, Destin Reder was indicted for the second degree murder of Samantha Johnson Reder, who was the decedent in the alleged domestic abuse battery case. The complaint alleges that Reder had gotten off of work from McDonald's on the night of Samantha's death, and had borrowed a vehicle from a neighbor to get alcohol. According to the complaint, when the two were in an argument, Reder allegedly choked his wife until she stopped breathing and died. The SEC alleges that the defendant then allegedly choked her and she died as a result of the attack. The court also found that, contrary to the defendant's claims, he did not have a history of mental illness, bipolar disorder, or any other drug-related or mental condition. In addition to his youth, he points out that his criminal history is limited to misdemeanor offenses; thus, as a first felony offender, Defendant should not have received a maximum sentence for this offense.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice's Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigatory Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage people to check the backgrounds of people who commit or are victims of domestic violence.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investigations\u00c2\u00a0in this matter\u00c2\u00a0have been conducted in the SEC's New Orleans Regional Office,\u00c2\u00a0with the assistance of the Office of the United States Attorney\u00c2\u00a0for the Southern Division of New Orleans and the Division of Criminal Justice.

For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-20-2016. \u00c2\u00a0On March 18, 2019, the Honorable Judge Steven A. Mascianica entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Release Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.
