  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against a North Carolina-based company that issued an automobile insurance policy to a Florida man who suffered traumatic brain damage and other serious injuries in an automobile accident.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that Jason T. Crouse purchased this policy through his agent, Jeannie Scott, in North Carolina. According to the complaint, Crouse reported the accident to Ms. Scott on 5 November 2007, and informed her that he had to call a 1-800-Allstate telephone number to report the loss. The complaint alleges that the 5.C.2. provision provided that the Facility had complete discretion over whether to make a reimbursement, and that the Board of Governors had the discretionary power to determine whether to do so.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Crouse. The SEC previously charged Crouse with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 5(d) of that federal law. The court also found that Crouse violated the reporting provision of Section 5 of the Facility's Standard Practice Manual, which requires the Facility to report any loss or injury to a member of its organization.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the Facility has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $13,800,000. The judgment also prohibits the Facility from issuing or denying a request for reimbursement of any part of a claim arising out of the event. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (2014).  The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Enforcement's Risk Analysis and Detection Center. The litigation will be led by John R. Baddour, Jr. and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Carolina Department of Insurance in this matter."
