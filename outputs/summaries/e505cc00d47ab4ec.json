  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against two companies that claimed to have been unlawfully expropriated in violation of international law.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that, beginning in the late 1990s, Oklahoma-based Helmerich & Payne International Drilling Co. (H&P-IDC) and its wholly owned subsidiary, H&PIDC, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  According to the complaint, the company was chartered in Cuba in order to acquire \"some of the largest, most powerful, and deepest-drilling, land-based drilling rigs available\" in the country.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in seizing the company\u2019s assets, Venezuela and PDVSA violated the anti-fraud provision of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1940 (\"FISA\").  The complaint further alleges that the company failed to show that it had any legitimate right to expropriate its assets, including the right to attend and vote at general meetings, and that, in seizing its company assets, it had no right to participate in the expropriation of those assets.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, both companies consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their respective profits.  Finally, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, and ordered the companies to pay civil penalties of $1.5 million and $1 million, respectively.  On August 9, 2017, the U.K. District Judge in Miami entered a judgment against the companies that had, in effect, violated international law by expropriating the company's assets and then denying the companies\u2019 requests for a preliminary injunction, ordering that the companies return their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest and pay civil monetary penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  Separately, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida today announced parallel criminal charges against the company.  A parallel administrative proceeding was instituted against the two companies, which was conducted by John R. Stevenson and Fernando Torres of the Miami Regional Office, with the assistance of the United Kingdom Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United Nations Office of Economic and Risk Analysis."
