  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against defendant Frederick Lee, Jr., who was convicted of three felony counts of sexual assault of a child and two counts of indecency with a child.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on October 26, 2016, Lee was sentenced to thirty-years' confinement in the Institutional Division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.  The SEC alleges that Lee failed to disclose to the court that he had been previously convicted of felony possession of cocaine and had been sentenced to 30 months of hard labor in the Department of Corrections.  Lee also allegedly failed to corroborate his prior convictions with evidence presented in the case.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Lee, charging Lee with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) of Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Lee consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar.  On November 13, 2013, Lee pleaded guilty to one felony count of possession of a controlled substance, and was sentenced as a multiple offender to a thirty-year prison sentence.  After serving his sentence, Lee agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  He also agreed to a six-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, including securities in exchange for a share of the proceeds of the sale of a penny stock, to settle a civil action brought by the SEC against him by the agency in which he was previously convicted.  As part of the settlement, Lee will also be prohibited from associating with any third-party, including a lawyer, broker, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal accountant, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.
