  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a coal ash case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality improperly issued two mining permits and improperly dismissed a second mining permit.  According to the complaint, on 5 June 2015, the Department of Energy, Mineral and Land Resources and Division of Health and Human Resources issued two additional mining permits. The SEC alleges that these permits violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the Department and Permittees violated Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15a-1 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, contrary to the Department's and the Permittee\u2019s representations, the final judgment improperly granted the involuntary dismissal without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for North Carolina announced criminal charges against Green Meadow, LLC, Charah, Inc., and Green Meadow. Green Meadow and Charah consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws. The final judgment permanently enjoins Green Meadow from violating Section 15A of the Exchange Act and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 17, 2017, the Honorable Carl R. Fox of the U.C. District court for the Northern District of Carolina granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Green Meadow to comply with the court's order. The court also issued an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue an order suspending or issuing an order freezing the defendants\u2019 assets. The order also prohibits the issuance of a cease-and-desist letter or other emergency relief, including an asset freeze, from appearing before the court as an attorney or practicing before the SEC as an impartial judge. The Court also ordered the SEC to conduct a preliminary examination of the issues raised by the complaint in its order, including whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant a determination of the merits of the complaint by the court. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division. The litigation will be led by Jennifer A. Basinger and supervised by Gregory A. Kasper.
