  "summary": "On February 14, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin entered a final judgment in favor of the Wisconsin Department of Justice against Dennis L. Schwind for violating the federal securities laws.  The court found that Schwind violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Schwind's complaint, filed in federal district court in Madison, Wisconsin, alleges that, in 2001, Schwind pled guilty to first-degree sexual assault of a child, incest with a child and engaging in repeated acts of sexual assault with the same child.  According to the court's order, the court had the inherent authority to reduce or terminate a term of probation for cause, but did not have the power to impose a penalty.  In a parallel action, the Wisconsin Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed criminal charges against Schwind, charging him with violating the securities laws, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of over 100 years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Schwind complaint, the attorney general's office has issued an order suspending Schwind from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney, and imposing a $1,000 civil penalty on Schwind.  On February 21, 2019, the Court of Appeals issued a preliminary injunction against further violations of the securities law, ordering Schwind to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Wiedenhoeft and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Wisconsin Office of Inspector General in this matter."
