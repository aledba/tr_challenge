  "summary": "On May 25, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against defendants North Central, LLC (North Central), Manor Bowling and Billiard, Inc. (Manor Bowling), and their liability insurance company, Auto Owners Insurance Company (Auto Owners), for breach of contract for failing to honor a judgment in a personal injury action.  The court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Auto Owners to pay $332,425 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In its order, the court also found that Auto Owners violated the collateral attack provision of Section 2-619 of the Exchange Act.  According to the court's order, in a parallel action, filed on September 18, 2017, plaintiff filed a civil injunctive action against the defendants, alleging that their negligence caused her to slip, fall, and injure herself on February 16, 2013, at a bowling alley under defendants' control. The court denied her motion to enforce the settlement agreement on the basis of a non-settling basis, and the court granted the defendants' request for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of these provisions, and orders them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount owed to them by the court in the settlement action. The judgment also prohibits defendants from violating the collateral-attack provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and orders defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000. The SEC's order also requires defendants to provide a copy of the SEC's Judgment, which is subject to court approval, to be filed in a court-ordered administrative proceeding, and to be reviewed and approved by a court at a later date.  For example, the SEC seeks a judgment ordering the defendants to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, imposing civil penalties, and imposing officer-and-director and penny stock bars against each of the defendants.   The SEC also seeks a court order requiring defendants to comply with the court order, ordering the SEC to provide an accounting of the alleged losses, and ordering the payment of any civil penalty to be determined by a jury at a subsequent hearing. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, charges defendants with violating Section"
