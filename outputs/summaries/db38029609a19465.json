  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Lafontaines for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that Thomas Watley of Hickory Hill, Ga., was the sole owner of the unimproved land and that he decided to develop the land for resale when he asked his friend, Robert and Diane Lafontaine, for advice on how to proceed with the development of the property. According to the complaint, Watley signed and submitted a final plat stating that it complied with the county subdivision regulations, even though he was personally unaware of whether those regulations had been complied with. The complaint also alleges that Watley failed to check to make sure that the placement of the utilities coincided with the final plat.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2011 Watley sent a letter to Harris County requesting a variance in his capacity as a developer, when the two of them realized that a narrower road than originally planned for would be more attractive.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $10,000.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  On August 5, 2016, the court granted summary judgment to Watley on all of his claims, except for the one related to negligent construction of the gas supply line and other utilities, and granted him a second motion for summary judgment on his behalf on all claims, including the one relating to his role as a contractor in clearing the land and developing the subdivision.   The court also denied the defendants\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction, which would have required the defendants to show cause and effect the entry of a judgment imposing a permanent injunction, ordering Watley to comply with the court\u2019s order, and ordering him to pay a civil penalties of $15,000 each.  Finally, on September 21, 2016 the trial court denied a motion to vacate the May 2011 summary judgment order and granted the defendants a temporary restraining order against further violations of Section 17(a)(1) of The Securities Act of 1933, and ordered that the defendants return their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest and pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  This order also prohibits the defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security"
