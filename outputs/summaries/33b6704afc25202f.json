  "summary": "On January 20, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico entered a final judgment against Tri-State Careflight, LLC, a New Mexico-based medical transport company, and its co-defendant, Keith Bastian, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the defendants agreed to pay $182,867.16 in attorneys' fees and costs, including $325.00 per hour for Mr. Moody, and $375.00 for his counsel, Cason N. Heard and Gregory K. Welch.  The court also granted the defendants' motion for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order.  In its order, the court also ordered the defendants to pay a $2,500.00 civil penalty, which is equal to the amount of attorney fees that the court previously ordered them to pay, and to pay an additional $1,500 in prejudgment interest.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay disgorgement of $1.4 million, plus prejudgment interests of $2.2 million, and impose a civil penalty of $250,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The court will determine whether to impose a permanent injunction, impose a $50,000 civil monetary penalty, and appoint a receiver to determine the appropriate amount of fees to be paid by the parties.
