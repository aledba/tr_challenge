  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against the United States Attorney General's Office for the Southern District of New York for the purpose of expediting processing of a request for documents related to the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., alleges that on April 18, 2019, Attorney General William Barr held a press conference in advance of the public release of a report prepared by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on the investigation.  According to the complaint, Barr stated that the evidence developed by the Special Counsel \"was not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.\"  The complaint further alleges that the Attorney General had mischaracterized some of the core conclusions contained in the report, which he concluded were insufficient to establish the President's obstruction of justice offense.  In its judgment, the court found that Barr violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Barr consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078.71, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and from participating in the issuance or promotion of any federal securities law.  On May 28, 2020, the Court granted the motion for expedited processing of the request for the documents, which is subject to court approval.  A hearing is scheduled for 5:30 p.m. EST on June 5, 2020.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release Release Bulletin No. 552(a)(6)(E)(iii).  The Commission's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's Complaint alleges that, contrary to the Commission's findings, Barr acted as a personal counsel for the President or on behalf of the American public, and that Barr was acting as an unregistered broker of information in connection with the release of the report.\u00c2\u00a0 The Commission has also issued an Investor Alert about the potential impact of an investigation on the safety and integrity of government agencies."
