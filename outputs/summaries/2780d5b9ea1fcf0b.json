Harris violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that defendants failed to adequately monitor the performance of the Plan and failed to take reasonable steps to remediate the issues raised in the complaint.  In addition, the complaint alleged that defendants violated Rule 23(b)(3) by failing to adequately report material losses to the Plan's investment committee, which included Leber and Kennedy.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against each of them.

A hearing on September 21, 2017 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  To learn more about class actions, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (Aug. 24, 2015).
