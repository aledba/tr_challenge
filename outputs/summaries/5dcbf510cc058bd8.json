  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former officer of the New York City Police Department who filed an amended complaint alleging that the Police Benevolent Association (PBA) failed to provide him with legal representation in prior employment discrimination lawsuits.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on June 29, 2016, the former officer filed a complaint in federal court in Manhattan alleging that PBA violated the duty of fair representation by failing to provide legal representation to him in two employment discrimination cases.  The complaint alleges that the union violated its duty to fair representation when it refused to provide representation for the plaintiff in those lawsuits. The complaint also alleges that, because the union has represented female police officers in cases alleging pregnancy discrimination, the plaintiff has a right to be represented.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the union's refusal to provide the plaintiff legal representation for those lawsuits is time-barred.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the amended complaint, the officer consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his legal fees.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court entered a temporary restraining order against the officer and ordered him to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, to be determined by the court at a later date.  On January 11, 2017, the Court granted the officer's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The court also ordered the officer to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  To settle the case, PBA agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations.  PBA also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of five years. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Frimpong and supervised by C.J. Kerik. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Mr. Fraser and Ms. Fraser. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221, Lit. 206 (2d Cir. 1997)."
