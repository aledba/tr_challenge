  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against defendant Elmer Emmanuel Eychaner III, III, who was convicted on five counts of disseminating and disseminating child pornography.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia on May 13, 2018, the court entered a temporary restraining order against Eychaners from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC alleges that, in violation of Section 1466A of the Exchange Act and Rule 1466b-1 thereunder, the defendant knowingly removed his computer's hard drive and placed it down a storm drain.  As alleged in the complaint, however, this action did not result in a conviction, as the court found.  In a parallel action, on May 16, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the Court granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws, and ordered the defendant to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the Judge granted the Court's Order for a Temporary Restraining Order, a temporary injunction, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 12b2-3, and 14a-11 thereunder; and a $10,000 civil penalty for each of the five counts.   The court's order also prohibits the defendant from associating with any person who is not registered as a sex offender with the purpose of obtaining a judgment of acquittal against him.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release No. 5, No. 13, or 13, under the supervision of Kelly L. Gibson, Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 15(b)(2) thereunder of Exchange Rules 12a-14 and 13b-15.  It also orders the court to appoint a receiver for the receiver of the receiver, which will determine the amount of restitution to be paid to the receiver.  Finally, the Court ordered the receiver to remove any evidence that could be used to determine the nature of the alleged dissemination of child pornography, including the content of the images on the receiver's computer, and to provide an explanation for why the receiver should not have access to the images.  Additionally, the receiver must provide a sufficient amount of information to determine whether the receiver is a reasonable person."
