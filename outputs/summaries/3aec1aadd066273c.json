  "summary": "On March 19, 2018, the Honorable Thomas H. Lock of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina entered a final judgment against defendant Omari Smith, Jr., who was previously convicted of first-degree murder, robbery with a dangerous weapon, assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury of Mr. Ricky Lynch (\u201cMr. Lynch\u201d), and conspiracy to commit robbery.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Charlotte, North Carolina, Smith and his friend, Darius McCalston, agreed to participate in a series of robberies in which they used bandanas, guns, and clown masks to carry out the robberies.  The complaint alleges that Smith, a co-defendant, made phone calls to Montes\u2019 mother and grandmother, who were members of the Crip gang.  In one instance, Smith allegedly threatened Montes with a gun and a clown mask, and Montes allegedly used the mask to threaten his mother.  As alleged in the complaint, Smith, Montes' mother, and grandmother also showed up at the residence to engage in a conversation with Montes about his alleged involvement in the robbery, which led to the defendants agreeing to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins Smith from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Smith to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Smith agreed to settle the case against him by agreeing to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay disgorgement of $1,945, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty against him.  Montes agreed to a settlement that permanently restrains her from violating these provisions, and agreed to be barred from appearing in court as a witness for the purpose of recovering her stolen property.  Smith also agreed to pay an $8,500 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.  On March 24, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Smith, alleging that he violated the antitrust provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0Securities Act of 1940 and Rule\u00c2\u00a0804(a)(5) and (c) thereunder.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the United States Attorney's Office, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
