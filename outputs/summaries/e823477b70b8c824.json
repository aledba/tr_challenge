  "summary": "On March 7, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a defendant in a civil injunctive action brought by a former construction worker who was injured in an automobile accident.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan on April 27, 2016, Gil Bergman, a former truck driver, and his wife, Maria Rodriguez, raised the issue of liability by submitting evidence that the defendant had set the ladder up on top of a drop cloth to prevent him from falling.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of the defendant's actions and omissions, the defendant was barred from maintaining a personal injury action against his or her employer.  In addition, as alleged in the complaint, the defendants failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether the plaintiff was a recalcitrant worker.  For example, the SEC alleges that the plaintiff's employer, Westchester Management, was not a \"recalcitrant employer\" when he or she was injured, and that the defendants did not employ persons to maintain the property where he was injured and to pay their salaries.  As a result, the complaint seeks summary judgment against the defendant, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar against Gil.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the basis that it was barred under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Gil and Maria Rodriguez consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, and sale of any securities in the United States, including the securities of publicly-traded companies.  Rodriguez also agreed to be enjoined from associating with any third party that is liable for the same conduct as the defendant.  Finally, Rodriguez agreed to a judgment that permanently restrains her from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and orders her to pay civil penalties equal to her profits in the amounts of $1,000, $2,500, and $100,000 each.  A final judgment ordering Rodriguez to disgorge $2.25 million in ill-advised prejudgment interests and pay $1.75 million in civil penalties"
