  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against a defendant who was found liable for three counts of criminal neglect of an elderly adult.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, from at least February 2016 through February 2017, the defendant, who was nearly 76 years old when she fell to the floor of her mobile home in February 2016, engaged in a pattern of misconduct that included lying on the floor for multiple days in her own waste, urinating on herself, and defecating on herself. The complaint further alleges that the defendant was aware that the victim had fallen and was unable to get up from the floor, and that she did not call for help until the fifth day after the fall.  According to the complaint, despite having agreed to do more than just buy groceries for and feed the victim, the victim continued to urinate on herself and did not respond to the calls for help.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On February 20, 2016, the jury found the defendant liable for negligent homicide based upon the defendant's failure to inform the court that she had suffered a serious and unjustifiable injury.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the Defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 626:2, II(d) (2014).  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and the return of any civil penalty. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Connecticut Department of Banking and Securities and the Connecticut Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigation Release\u00c2\u00a0to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to determine whether to proceed with a criminal charge.\u00c2\u00a0On February 21, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, including an order appointing a receiver to oversee the investigation of the matter, ordering a hearing on February 24, 2018. The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted"
