  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a Chicago-area transit company for negligent operation of a train.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago on June 1, 2017, Jerome M. Anderson was injured on a train platform while attempting to board a train and fell on the platform.  The complaint alleges that Anderson was not a train passenger but merely a CTA employee.  As alleged in the complaint, the CTA failed to adequately monitor decedent's activities on the train platform and failed to provide timely and effective assistance to the injured.  In addition, the complaint alleges, Anderson had been drinking heavily and was half-asleep when he fell, and did not respond to the train's call for assistance.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Anderson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 24, 2019).  The SEC&rdquo:  The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Kaczorowski and supervised by Marc Blau of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Bilyk. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Police Department, the Illinois Department of Transportation, and the Chicago Fire Department."
