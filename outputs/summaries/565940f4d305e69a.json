  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on September 25, 2019, entered a final judgment against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for violating the common law privilege against courthouse arrests.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that, since at least January 2017, ICE has increased its civil arrests in New York state courthouses by 1700 percent and more than 700 percent, respectively, since January 2017.  According to the complaint, this increase is in part because of the fact that, as alleged, the federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over immigration arrests, and that, under the federal law, an individual can't be arrested without a court order.  In addition, the complaint alleges that ICE has a duty to enforce the federal criminal laws, including Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, and ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the United States, and a penny stock bar against each of them.  Finally, the Court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 704 of the Exchange Act, ordering the officers to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest and pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  On October 2, 2020, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Manhattan, charging ICE with violating the federal pre-clearance provision of Section 12(b)(1) and the antifraud provisions of Section 13(a) of Exchange Act Rule 12b2-1. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations, as well as an order freezing the assets of the defendants, and to bar them from serving as officers or directors of any federal agency, including the Department of Homeland Security, from issuing or enforcing any order or order issuing an immigration arrest.  Separately, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against two individuals for their roles in the scheme of the alleged scheme.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for October 13, 2020."
