  "summary": "On May 22, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the New York City Police Department (\"NYPD\") in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that the NYPD violated the antifraud provisions of Sections 160.50 and 160.55 of the Criminal Procedure Law (\"CPL\") and that, in violation of those provisions, the NYPD routinely and unlawfully discloses arrest and prosecution information to media and other agencies without court permission. The complaint also alleges that, contrary to the stated intent of the CPL, the defendants' use of the sealed information was not a violation of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws. In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants failed to disclose to the court that they were not subject to the mandatory seal provision of the statute, that the defendants were not a \"law enforcement agency\" when they were arrested, and that they had no right to access and use sealed arrest information. The SEC also alleged that, when an arrest or prosecution is terminated in favor of the accused, the defendant's right to be made whole to the status of his or her right to an attorney or other reasonable place to make an application for an officer-and-director bar. The court's order against the defendants, which was entered by the court on May 24, 2014, permanently enjoins the defendants from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and requires the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000. The defendants also have agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a related administrative proceeding, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze. The case was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Criminal Justice Services. The litigation will be led by R.C. and A.G. and supervised by Alyssa S. Mehraban."
