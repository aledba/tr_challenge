  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of IBM's motion for summary judgment against the company, alleging that it violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that IBM and its litigation expert, David Eastburn, violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Patent Act of 1940.  According to the complaint, Eastburn and his firm misrepresented to the court that the patents were subject to a \"check-in\" rule that requires a reasonable determination of whether a product is a \"patented item\" or a \"transactionable product.\"  The complaint further alleges that, in reality, the patents are not subject to the check-in rule, and that Eastburn's firm failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its claims.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against IBM and Eastburn.  On May 12, 2012, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Donnelly of the U.N. District Division of Justice issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering IBM to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000.  IBM also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty in a parallel criminal case.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5,796,849 (D.I.&rsquo; Lit. No. 459, 2013).  The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Patent and Trademark Abuse. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Patent Education and the Securities and Exchange Commission in this matter."
