  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Erek Slater, a bus operator employed by the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA), finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's order, filed on May 25, 2018, Slater was elected as a union representative at the CTA's North Park bus garage in January 2015.  The SEC alleges that on March 7, 2015, a CTA staff member confronted Slater about the use of the office and threatened him with being fired if he did not comply with the Board's order to revoke access to the office.  In a complaint filed in federal court in Chicago, Slater alleges that he was unlawfully deprived of the benefits of using the office after he had a disagreement with CTA management during a safety meeting.  As alleged in the complaint, this action was not an adverse employment action, and Slater was not required to make a showing of an adverse action.  Instead, the complaint alleges that Slater violated the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws, and that the Board failed to properly examine Slater's charge under section 10(b)(1) and (a)(2) and that it failed to consider whether Slater had a reasonable interest in the office's use.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Slater consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Bilstrom and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Police Department, the Illinois Department of Education, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
