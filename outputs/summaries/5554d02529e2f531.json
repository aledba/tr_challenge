  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Manhattan Beach Unified School District (MBUSD) that permanently enjoins MBUSD from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders MBUSD to pay for the costs of B.H.\u2019s placement in a residential treatment center.  The court also found that MBUSD was not required to implement the November 2014 IEP because it was not a \"public agency\" and did not have access to the IEP.  According to the court order, MBUSD also had no obligation to provide B.h. with appropriate education and related services.  In addition, the court found MBUSD not responsible for the placement of a child with severe mental health needs, because it had not provided the child with the appropriate education or related services for which he was entitled.  MBUSD agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, and to pay $2,288 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a $1,000 civil penalty.  On February 12, 2015, a federal district court in San Diego entered a temporary restraining order against MBUSD and ordered it to pay a civil penalty of $3,192. The court granted MBUSD's request for an asset freeze and a temporary officer-and-director bar, and ordered the district to pay the civil penalty at a later date.  A hearing scheduled for March 19, 2020, was scheduled for 5:30 p.m. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the San Diego Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Education's Office of Education and Advocacy. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The examination that led to the discovery of the SEC's findings was conducted by Eric R. Werner in the Office of Inspector General's Analysis and Detection Center. The investigation was supervised by Scott A. Kasper, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Division of Special Education, with assistance from Joseph G. Sansone, Regional Director of the Department of Health and Human Services, and Senior Trial Counsel for the District of San Diego.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Education, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
