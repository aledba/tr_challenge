  "summary": "On December 28, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma entered a final judgment against Richard Trent, Jr., a convicted felon in possession of a firearm who was sentenced to 196 months in prison.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Oklahoma City, Mr. Trent raised the issue of whether the Oklahoma conspiracy statute was divisible and whether a prior conviction qualifies as a serious drug offense under the ACCA.  The complaint alleges that, contrary to what the court had previously held, Trent attempted to raise a new claim under the federal conspiracy statute by claiming that his prior felony conviction did not qualify as a \"serious drug offense.\"  The SEC further alleges that the complaint was untimely because, as alleged in the complaint, he attempted to add the new claim to the existing one-year statute of limitations and failed to convince a jury that he had committed a serious felony.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Trent.  On December 29, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Trent, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his prior sentence.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Trent consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to be barred from serving any prison term for five years, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future.  He also agreed to be enjoined from associating with any person who has a prior criminal conviction for a felony, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest in a civil penalty of $1,000,000.   The court also granted a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against him, which is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 545 (Dec. 28, 2014).  The U. S. Attorney's office for the Eastern District of California today announced parallel criminal charges. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Criminal Investigations has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Abuse and Detection Center has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint Alert\u00c2\u00a0to detect suspicious patterns of activity, including:    Computer Fraud and Abuse Abuse (CFSA) fraud, and\u00c2\u00a0Computer Fraud Detection (CFDI) Detection Center (CFD)."
