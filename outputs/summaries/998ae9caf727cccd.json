  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maine on May 25, 2018 entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant's motion for an obstruction-of-justice enhancement.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Maine, alleges that Steven Nygren, a Brooklin, Maine resident, forged at least 63 checks, totaling over $732,000, and deposited the proceeds into an account that he controlled. According to the complaint, the defendant then went on the offensive, circulating a letter at his store stating that \"there are at least 2 sides to every story\" and that \"nothing is ever as it seems.\" The complaint further alleges that the defendant's false statements to competency evaluators were inconsistent with his intent to avoid responsibility for the charged crimes. The complaint alleges that, in reality, he had feigned incompetency, which is not a prerequisite for a competency enhancement, and that he had failed two tests administered by his own expert to detect malingering: the test of memory loss (TOMM) and the validity indicator profile (VIP), the latter being designed to identify valid and invalid responding to a test. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Nygren consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay $815,496.27 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Nygren. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Maine Department of Justice, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
