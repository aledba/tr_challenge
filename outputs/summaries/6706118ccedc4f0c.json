  "summary": "On February 27, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of a class action against Ocean Harbor Casualty Insurance Company, a Florida-based no-fault automobile insurer.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that, from at least 1965 through at least 1980, the federal government provided a private cause of action for double damages under the Medicare Secondary Payer Act of 1940.  According to the complaint, under this provision, a primary plan is liable as a primary payer for medical services, treatment, or supplies, even if the primary plan does not pay the medical bills.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the secondary payer has the right and responsibility to make payments when payment is available.  For example, the SEC alleges that in 2012, Congress created a \"right of appeal\" provision for primary plans that imposed a requirement of preauthorization for major surgeries.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, that this provision was not applicable to all of the primary plans under which the complaint was filed.  Instead, the Complaint alleges that Ocean Harbor violated the federal securities laws by failing to timely make payments to certain of its insureds in violation of federal and state law.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Ocean Harbor consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the above-mentioned provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $19,155.41, which is equal to the civil penalty imposed by the SEC.    In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Florida today announced parallel criminal charges against the defendants. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0instant.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and to quickly determine whether to apply for a broker-dealer exemption.  This matter is being handled by John Rymas, Chief of the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, under the supervision of Scott Frost.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Florida Department of Insurance, and the Florida Secretary of Health and Human Services in this matter."
