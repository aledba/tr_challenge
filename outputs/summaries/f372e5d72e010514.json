  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services in a civil injunctive action brought by Reproductive Health Centers, Inc., a Pennsylvania-based reproductive health center.  The SEC's complaint, filed on January 16, 2019, alleges that the Pennsylvania department of health and human services violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, in violation of Rule No. 2327(4), the department violated the prerogative of the General Assembly to control the state's finances. In a separate case, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office and the Department of Public Welfare agreed to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains the scope of their power to legislate under the federal laws. The court also ruled that the department had a duty to protect the interests of the victims of the earlier litigation.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against one of the defendants. The case was investigated by the SEC's Office of Inspector General, which issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0report\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0successor of\u00c2\u00a0their investment in\u00c2\u00a0that investment.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Office of Health Education and Advocacy (OIEA) in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17(b)(5) of 2018. \u00c2\u00a0On June 21, 2019 the Court granted a temporary restraining order and entered a preliminary injunction against further violations of the federal anti-fraud provisions.  On July 31, 2020, the Court issued an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue an order suspending or issuing an order requiring the receiver to comply with the court's order. The receiver will determine the amount of relief to be provided by the court upon motion of the receiver.   The court will determine how to proceed with the investigation.  This matter is being handled by the Office of Advocacy, which administers and administers the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure. The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people who are seeking to participate in litigation by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals."
