  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Yusuf Hotep-El, a defendant who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, on April 3, 2017, Hotep El, who was arrested for possession of cocaine, falsely claimed that he was competent to represent himself in a jury trial.  The complaint alleges that, in reality, he was not competent.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the trial court found that he could not represent himself because he was a \"sovereign citizen\" who had a severe mental illness.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced that it had obtained a temporary restraining order and an order suspending the defendant from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney.  On May 24, 2018, the court granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction and appointed a public defender to represent him in the case.  At a hearing in April 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Mississippi Department of Criminal Justice."
