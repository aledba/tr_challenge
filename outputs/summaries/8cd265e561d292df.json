  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was convicted of two felony counts of disseminating child pornography.  According to the court's order, filed on May 13, 2016, in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, a convicted felon who was sentenced to a total of twenty years in prison for disseminating and distributing child pornography, agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and agreed to a five-year mandatory minimum prison term without parole.  The court granted the defendant's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered him to surrender his passport, and issued an order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the court.  On May 28, 2015, the court entered a judgment against the defendant that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of five years and a $1,000,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey announced criminal charges against a defendant in connection with the same conduct.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from further violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The court also ordered the defendant to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordered the sentencing of the defendant at a later date.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Kromphold of the New Jersey Office of the Attorney General's Office and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Police Department, the FBI, and the U.N. Secret Service in this matter."
