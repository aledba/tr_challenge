  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Hawai'i today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on January 6, 2015, defendant Pierre Hernandez entered a no contest plea to the charged offense of harassment by stalking.  According to the complaint, while Hernandez agreed to be present at a change of plea and to be questioned in open court, he did not waive his right of allocution prior to sentencing.  Instead, the complaint alleges, he signed a plea by mail document indicating that he was waiving his right to be represented at a hearing and that he understood that the court would impose a penalty in the absence of a hearing.  In a parallel action, on March 17, 2017, a federal district court in Hawaii issued a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from violating these provisions, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  On March 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone granted the SEC's motion for a temporary restraining order against Hernandez, which was later granted by the court.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Sansone consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws.  Sansone agreed to a permanent injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance of any civil injunctive relief, including an officer-and-director bar, as well as a bar against him from appearing before a jury as a result of his prior criminal conviction.  To settle the SEC\u2019s case, the court agreed to the imposition of a permanent restraining order and to a hearing suspension. The court also agreed to conduct an on-the-record colloquy with the defendant to determine whether to grant the SEC the right to a fair trial and to consider the merits of the case before it is decided.  A hearing suspension order would be instituted following a court finding that the defendant violated the federal anti-fraud rule.  For further information, see State v. Carvalho, 90 Hawai\u2018i 262, 265 n.2, 978 P.2d 718, 724 (1999).  The Honorable Gerald R. Kasper has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the appointment of a receiver and to the payment of a $1,000 civil penalty. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Hawaii, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Justice in this matter."
