  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon today entered final judgments against defendants Blue Elephant Holdings, LLC and Donald Morse for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, alleges that from approximately February 2016 through March 2016, Blue Elephant and Morse engaged in a pattern of misconduct in which employees complained about alleged black mold on a vent in the restroom.  According to the complaint, the employees allegedly demanded that the vent be removed immediately after the customer confronted them about the video.  As alleged, Brown, Harris, Cohen, and Leonetti then sent Plaintiff home from work on the morning of March 7, 2016, after she complained about the vent.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Morse.  On March 8, 2017, the court granted the SEC's motion for summary judgment against Morse and ordered him to pay $1,078.71 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $2,077.71.  Morse consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains, and orders the company to pay civil penalties in the amount of $3,076.71, which represents a total of $959.95.  Brown agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  Leonetti also agreed to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for the period after March 22, 2016 when she was notified she could not return to work and failed to do so.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for May 24, 2017.    The court's order against Morse was entered by the SEC on March 5, 2016. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Oregon Department of Health and Human Services in this matter.
