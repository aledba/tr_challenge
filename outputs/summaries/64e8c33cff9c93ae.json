  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Michael Thompson, a former chief electronic technician and crew member on board the Polar Pioneer.  According to the SEC's complaint, on October 25, 2014, Thompson was called to testify regarding safety programs that he had designed and implemented for companies that hired him for that purpose, as well as to compare the training programs he had implemented to the one at issue, and to opine as to the safety and reasonableness of Transocean's programs.  As alleged in the complaint, however, Thompson opted to participate and ride the FlowRider four times, until he fell, purportedly sustaining injuries to his neck and back.  The complaint further alleges that after the hearing, the district court granted Thompson's motion in limine to exclude evidence of his receipt of long-term disability benefits.  In a parallel action, on November 2, 2018, the United States District Court in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, entered a judgment against Thompson that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Thompson consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from further violations of these provisions, ordering him to disgorge $1,038, and ordering a temporary restraining order against him.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Thompson, Ms. Gibson, and Mr. Gautreaux. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.
