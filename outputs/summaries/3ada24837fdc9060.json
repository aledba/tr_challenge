  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maine today entered a final judgment against Merck & Co., Inc., a company that manufactures and sells birth control.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Maine, alleges that, in January 2012, Kayla Doherty visited the Lovejoy Health Center in Albion, Maine to inquire about birth control options. She met with a doctor, who recommended implantable contraception in the form of either Implanon or Nexplanon. According to the complaint, the doctor used a syringe-type applicator to insert the implant into Doherty's arm but did not examine her arm to ensure that it was properly inserted. The complaint also alleges that Doherty experienced physical pain and suffering, incurred medical expenses, and suffered lost wages due to her pregnancy. The court also ruled that the right to a trial by jury is not a legitimate governmental interest, and that the Legislature had \"occupied the field on this issue\" for the acts of the Center's doctor.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Maine today announced criminal charges against Doherty for her role in the alleged violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The case is being handled by Christopher R. Rymas of the SEC's Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans."
