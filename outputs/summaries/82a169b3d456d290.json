  "summary": "On October 8, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Stanley Pace, Jr., a Birmingham, Alabama man convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Pace, who lives in Birmingham, AL, was deficient in failing to offer a defense of his client, Harold Williams, by failing to provide adequate assistance to the jury.  According to the complaint, Williams told Pace that he was \"scared of a knife\" and told him that he had to stab Duke to save his own life.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, the jury found Pace not guilty on all of these counts.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the jury was not adequately instructed on the charged offense (first- and second-degree murders) and that Pace was not required to retreat or to consider whether he could safely retreat because he was in fear of being killed or receiving serious bodily harm.  Pace also allegedly told Williams that he would kill him if he had reasonable cause to believe that Duke was in imminent danger of being shot or killed by a self-defense or culpable-negligence manslaughter instruction, and that he \"busting\" Duke's lip with a pocketknife.\"  The complaint further alleges that, while Williams and Pace were playing video games, Pace and Duke got into a fight, and Pace told Williams, \"I'm going to kill your friend.\"  After the fight, Pace allegedly returned to the trailer, grabbed Williams's pocketknife, and told the jury, \u201cI killed your friend.\u201d  After this exchange, Pace ran outside to vomit off the porch and found Duke holding his pocketknife against his wrist.  At trial, the SEC found no ineffective assistance of counsel for the defendant.  Instead, the court found that Pace had \"no constitutional right to errorless counsel\" and that his \"right to reasonable professional assistance\" was insufficient to justify his failure to offer an adequate defense of the client.  On appeal, the Court also found that the defendant had \"reasonable cause\" to believe \"that he had a reasonable probability\" that Duke had killed him.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Pace consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $25,000.  Additionally, Pace agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company"
