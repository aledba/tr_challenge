  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against Wanda M. Field and her husband, Earl O. Field, in a case that was investigated by the Kansas Department of Health and Human Services (KDHSU). The court found that Field and Field had signed a joint will in 2010 that contained the purported codicil of Field's will, which was purportedly signed by Field. Field allegedly told Field that he would use his estate for his personal use and that Field would \"roll over in his grave\" if he knew his estate was going to be probated. Field's attorney, Bill Jeter, agreed to settle the case by agreeing to a judgment that permanently enjoins Field from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Field to pay attorney fees in the amount of $1,000,000. Field agreed to the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order. Field also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public university and to pay $2,500 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. Field consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating these provisions. The judgment also prohibits Field from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any such securities. Field has agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David Parrett and Carol Frost, and the litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Frost. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kansas Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Kansas Attorney General's Office Criminal Investigations, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the Missouri Department of Banking and Securities and the Kansas Office of Financial Regulation."
