  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former registered nurse assistant who was denied disability benefits based on her inability to perform work related activities.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Jeffery W. Bushman, D.O., for his role in a fraudulent scheme to steal Social Security benefits.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, Rector was not disabled because, considering her age, education, work experience, and residual functional capacity, she could work as an accounts investigator or a store facility rental clerk.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Rector had a history of fibromyalgia, a pacemaker, chronic pain, restless body syndrome, diverticulitis, anxiety, panic attacks, and fatigue.  As alleged in the complaint, Bushman's opinion was not supported by the medical record.  Rector subsequently sought treatment from a primary care physician for what she believed was trouble with her pacemaker.  On September 22, 2017, the SEC issued a final decision that permanently enjoins Bushman from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Welshhans has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge $1,078.95, and ordering Rector to pay a $20,000 civil penalty and a $25,000 officer and director bar, and imposing a $10,000 bar on Bushman and Rector.  He has also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the United States, including the right to reapply after five years of service.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Department of Health and Human Services, and the Federal Office of Inspector General.
