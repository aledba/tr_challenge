  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment in favor of Michigan Public Service Commission v. MISO, et al., (2017).  The Court of Appeals previously issued an order requiring the MPSC to determine whether to impose a local clearing requirement on alternative electric suppliers that do not meet their capacity obligations.  According to the court's order, MISO has a statutory obligation under the federal securities laws to ensure that all of its electricity suppliers meet its capacity requirements. The court also ordered MISO to implement a \"planning reserve margin\" rule that requires all providers to supply enough capacity to meet demand at times of peak demand.  The court found that MISO did not have the authority to impose such a rule on individual providers, and instead imposed a \"local clearing requirement\" on all of them.  In a parallel action, on September 15, 2017, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges against MISO for its role in the MISO case.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Michigan, charges MISO with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, Inc. (\"Advisers\").  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  On September 20, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica entered a judgment that permanently enjoins MISO from violating these provisions, and orders the Commission to conduct an independent examination of MISO's capacity planning. The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Department of Commerce, and the Michigan Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
