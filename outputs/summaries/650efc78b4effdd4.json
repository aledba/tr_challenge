  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a parental responsibilities order against Justin Lee Hill, the father of a child fathered by Hill, for failing to pay child support to the child.  According to the SEC's complaint, Hill, who was not a biological parent, sought to be named their primary residential parent.  The complaint alleges that, in 2006, when Hill became romantically involved and immediately moved in together with his then-wife, Anastasia C. Magana, he sought legal and physical custody for his biological son, A.F.  He also sought to have his biological father named as his \"primary residential parent.\"  In one of these cases, the court found that, as a psychological parent, Hill had a duty to provide support for the child, including providing summer and holiday visitation and shared legal custody of the child with the biological father.  In another case, in 2016, the same court issued an order requiring a parent to provide child support for a nonbiological child, which Hill refused to pay because he was not entitled to the same parental responsibilities as the biological parent under section 14-10-123 of the federal child support law.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in this case, Hill consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his child support obligation.  Hill also agreed to be barred from serving as a judge or jury in any proceeding for which he has a duty of support, including paying child support.   The court also ordered Hill to pay $1,000 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $100,000, which is the amount that Hill has agreed to pay in the future.  This settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-1.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Hill, charging him with violating Section 15(a)(1) and 15(b)(2)(A) and (c).  The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint alleges that Hill violated Sections 14(10) and 14(11) and 13("
