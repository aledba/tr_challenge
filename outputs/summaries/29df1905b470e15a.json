  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Brandon T. Kindelspire, a former construction manager for a telecommunications company who was convicted of failing to comply with his duty to report as a sex offender.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on March 19, 2014, Kindelsite was convicted in federal district court in Chicago of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 6 of the federal sex offender registration act.  The SEC alleges that Kindelspirite failed to register as a registered sex offender with the federal government and failed to notify the federal authorities that he had moved to Mazon, Illinois, from Morris, Illinois.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Kindlespire.    The complaint alleges that, contrary to the court's finding, the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, that Kindelpire was subject to the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Sex Offender Registration Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Kindelite consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a $50,000 civil penalty.  On May 17, 2015, the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, which is pending final approval by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Todd Horrie of the Chicago Regional Office, and the case was supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the Market Abuse Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Chicago Police Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Postal Inspection Service (FIRS), and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
