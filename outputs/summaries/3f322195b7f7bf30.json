  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment in favor of the District Attorney's Office's motion for a temporary restraining order against Christopher Allen Davis, who was convicted of three felony counts of sexual assault.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, alleges that Davis violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Davis consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) and ordering him to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Davis.  According to the SEC's order, Davis agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying any of the allegations in the complaint, and agreed to be permanently enjoined from further violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On August 11, 2009, K.R. and her friend, D.R., went to the house alone, injected methamphetamine and had an alcoholic drink, and then had sex with appellant while he was incapacitated and physically unable to resist.  A jury deliberated for two hours before finding Davis guilty of the three counts of felony sexual assault, and finding him liable for a civil penalty of $25,000, ordered him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and barred him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.   The court also found Davis liable for violating Section 206 of the Exchange Act for his role in the alleged scheme.  Without admitting to the charges, Davis has agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations and to a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged conduct of others, including in the sale of securities in the securities industry.  He has also agreed to the appointment of a Judge who will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interests, and civil penalties.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Aug. 20, 2018).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Dallas Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, the FBI, and the U."
