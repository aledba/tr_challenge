  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment in favor of the school district's motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that the Florida Department of Education violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Florida today announced criminal charges against a Florida resident accused of making a series of online threats to the school.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed on March 17, 2018, Miami Lakes Middle School was the target of an online threat that targeted the school's principal, a school administrator, and school security monitors.  As alleged in the complaint, the school principal directed that students be funneled through a single entrance and ordered a \"pat down\" of all backpacks.  At the onset of the trial, the defendant allegedly told the assistant principal that he was aware that law enforcement was at the school because of some postings he placed on the internet.  He allegedly replied affirmatively, without admitting or denying the allegations, that the threat was \"disruptive\" to school function or activity occurring on the school property.   The complaint alleges that, in reality, the threat did not occur on-campus, as the complaint alleges, and that the defendant knew it was probable that the student would cause disruption to school functions or the preparation of the defense.  Further, the complaint further alleges that O.P.G. provided a written confession, which was later suppressed by the lower court, that he made a \"misstatistic\" statement to the principal, and, at the onset, the student sought to interrupt the school function by telephoning the school from an off-campus location with a bomb threat hoax.  On March 18, 2019, the court granted the complaint and ordered the district attorney to appoint a receiver to oversee the investigation of the matter.  A hearing for the receiver was scheduled for May 24, 2019.  To determine whether to proceed with the litigation, the SEC requested that the court issue an order requiring the receiver to comply with the court's order, ordering a hearing on the matter, and ordering an injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws.  Finally, the Court granted the request for an emergency asset freeze and a temporary asset freeze, and imposed a $25,000 civil penalty against the receiver. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael R. Kasper and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson"
