  "summary": "On March 22, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in a related administrative proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that the agency violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that, in violation of the federal securities laws, the agency overstated the number of sources that could be eligible to reclassify as an area source under Section 112 of the Exchange Act. In addition, the complaint alleged that the Wehrum Memo, which was drafted by the agency's Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, failed to adequately represent the agency\u2019s position as to whether a source could be reclassified as a \u201cmajor source.\u201d The complaint further alleges that in a parallel action, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Department of Justice (D.C. Department of Health and Human Services) failed to provide any basis for the agency to revoke or deny an application to modify a permit for a major source under \u00a7 112. The SEC also alleged that, as a result of the agency action, it was unable to provide timely and appreciable legal advice to the agency staff and affected parties.  In a parallel administrative proceeding, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against the agency.  According to the complaint, the SEC's investigation was conducted by William Funk, under the supervision of Eric R. Werner, and supervised by Scott A. Thompson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Funk and Ms. Werner. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
