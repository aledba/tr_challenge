  "summary": "On August 2, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a New York-based municipal bond issuer for failing to pay principal and interest on certain of its bonds.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on September 4, 1997, the Province of Mendoza issued bonds in the principal amount of $250 million with a six-year limitations period. The complaint alleges that, by failing to timely pay principal, the bond issuer was barred from making interest payments on the bonds. The SEC alleges that the bonds were issued pursuant to a pre-determined statute of limitations, and that, as a result of this, interest continued to accrue on those bonds even after a claim for the principal itself was time-barred.  The complaint further alleges that Ajdler failed in any event to allege that, in the context of the post-Depression foreclosure moratorium enacted by the New York state legislature, the right to recover principal was barred, and the obligation to recover interest was likewise barred.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of $7,050,000 plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Ajdelman.  On August 3, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Ajelman, charging him with violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and with aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1. The court also issued an order requiring Ajelman to comply with Rule 13a-1, requiring him to provide a copy of the complaint to be filed with the SEC, and to provide an accounting of the amount of interest owed to the bondholder.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John J. Kassner and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by David A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority."
