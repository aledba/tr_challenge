  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Maryland today announced criminal charges against two men accused of orchestrating a multi-year scheme to steal millions of dollars from innocent victims.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Maryland, Corry Blue Evans and Robert Evans conspired to commit extortion, wire fraud, and bank fraud for the purpose of enriching themselves.  The complaint alleges that CorryBlue Evans enlisted Hollie Nadel, a co-defendant, into a scheme in which she would tell certain individuals that she owed large sums of money to nefarious actors, and that these actors would injure, kidnap, and unlawfully confine her unless the debt was paid.  Nadel allegedly purchased a shotgun and concealed it in her apartment, and the government sought to compel her to provide a buccal swab to compare the defendants' DNA to the evidence recovered from the crime.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has obtained a court order requiring the defendants to provide samples of their DNA to determine whether they possessed the same firearm.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Justice's Cyber Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the FBI conducted several search warrants in Manhattan in July and August 2019, which resulted in the discovery of a firearm and a shotgun recovered from another defendant's residence. The FBI also conducted several searches at the residences of several of the defendants, including one that yielded a mixture of male and female DNA that the FBI determined was suitable for comparison purposes. The court granted the FBI's request for a temporary restraining order against further violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a)"
