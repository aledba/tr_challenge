  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Mexican citizen for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1940.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that on November 20, 2014, an immigration officer discovered that Villarreal had been removed from the United States after having been previously deported following a previous criminal conviction for a felony. The complaint alleges that the officer then issued an expedited removal order, which was an element of a \u00a7 1326 criminal prosecution. The court found that the expedited order was fundamentally unfair because it required the defendant to show a reasonable probability that the removal was valid and that he would not have been deported.  In a parallel action, on August 27, 2018, a federal district court in Virginia issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendant\u2019s assets, and ordering him to surrender his passport and return to Mexico. The SEC alleges that, in issuing its order, the officer issued an order requiring the defendant in a later criminal prosecution to withdraw his application for admission under \u00a7 1225(a)(4). The court ruled that the order violated the due process provisions of the federal criminal laws, and that it had the right to determine whether to issue a final judgment imposing a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 1225, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The settlement is subject to court approval.  According to the SEC's continuing investigation, the agency's litigation will be led by Eric R. Werner and supervised by Lara S. Mehraban. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.K. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and the Mexican Attorney General's Office in this matter."
