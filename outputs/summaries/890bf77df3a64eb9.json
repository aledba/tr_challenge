  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Mississippi man who was convicted on three counts of sexual battery.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Robert Ellis, a convicted felon, had sex with his then-fourteen-year-old daughter, Kelly Lott, while Ellis was in the process of being sentenced to three concurrent terms of thirty years in the custody of the Department of Corrections.  According to the complaint, Ellis told Ellis that he had a rough childhood and admitted to having been attracted to younger girls for some time.  Ellis also claimed that Ellis had a \"hard stance\" on drug-related matters, and he had never forced his daughter to have sex with him.  In addition, Ellis allegedly claimed that Kelly showed him two packages of cigarettes, one found at the crime scene in the woods and the other in Ellis's jeep, and that Ellis \"used protection\" both times.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Ellis' wife, Vicky, and their four children, three sons and a daughter, all of whom were adopted by Ellis, were also victims of Ellis's alleged misconduct.  Vicky and her three children left the family's home on June 2, 2015, and Ellis was arrested the next day and charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  On June 4, Ellis pleaded guilty to one count of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance and was sentenced to 30 years in prison.  He also was ordered to undergo a mental evaluation to determine whether he had the capacity to assist his attorney in his defense and to stand trial on all three counts.   The court also granted Ellis's request for a temporary restraining order, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Ellis has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a $25,000 civil penalty.  Finally, Ellis agreed to be barred from serving as an officer and director of a public company, and to be restrained from participating in any offering of securities or offering of a penny stock.  A hearing for Ellis was scheduled for July 5, 2017. "
