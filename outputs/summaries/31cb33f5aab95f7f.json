  "summary": "On September 6, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana entered a final judgment against Southern Indiana Gas & Electric Company d/b/a Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. (\"Vectren\"), a public utility based in Evansville, Indiana, which provides energy-efficiency services to approximately 140,000 customers in six counties in southwestern Indiana.  The court found that the Commission's order was unreasonable because it did not consider the \"relationship of lost revenues with program costs\" and the \"cost and benefit analysis relied upon to determine whether recovery of the requested lost revenues was reasonable.\"  According to the court's order, the Commission failed to consider the financial condition of the utility or whether recovery would be reasonable.  In addition, the order expressly prohibits the Commission from requiring the utility to recover lost revenues for the life of the program.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission Order, the court also found that, as a result of its order, Southern Indiana violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and Rule 17a-1 thereunder. The court also ordered the company to pay a civil penalty of $1,500,000, which is equal to disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000 each.
