  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the City of Manhattan and its two adult bookstores for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that the City violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of its adult-use regulations in 1995.  According to the complaint, the Commission's 1995 Rules of Practice prohibited adult establishments from serving as a \"substantial portion\" of the adult establishments in New York City.  In addition, the complaint alleged that the Commission failed to adequately account for the adverse secondary effects of adult establishments on surrounding residential and commercial communities.  For example, as alleged in the complaint:  The Commission found that adult establishments with a predominant, ongoing focus on adult uses had negative secondary effects, such as increased crime, decreased quality of life, and the intrusion of adult bars and restaurants into the character of residential neighborhoods and commercial districts.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission&rsquo;s complaint, Defendants consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the federal securities laws, and ordered Defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits.

On May 23, 2018, the New York Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order against Defendants, ordering Defendants to comply with the court's order, and appointing a receiver to determine whether Defendants violated the federal, state, and municipal securities laws and to issue an order appointing an independent receiver to oversee the enforcement of the District of Columbia's adult-marketing rules.  As set forth in the Complaint, Defendants failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims.  Specifically, Defendants have failed to show that they are entitled to a court-ordered injunction, to a penny stock bar, and to an officer-and-director bar.  Defendant Defendants have also failed to disclose to the court that they have violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act, Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act and Rule 12b-20 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act, and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder; Defendants have agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to permanent injunctions and"
