  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment against Patricia Davis Pierce of Denham Springs, Louisiana, denying her request for final periodic support and partitioning the parties' former community property.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans on September 28, 2014, Patricia Pierce and her husband Steven Pierce were married in Key West, Florida. The complaint alleges that Steven Pierce was abusive to her during their twenty-one years of marriage, and Patricia was unable to provide him with sufficient financial support to pay for the purchase of the Eagle Drive home. Patricia also alleged that Steven had exclusive control of the boat, and that he had exclusive access to the boat.  The complaint further alleges that Patricia failed to provide sufficient evidence in support of her request to revoke her donation of 1/212 of her interest in the home to Steven.  In a parallel action, on October 4, 2018, a federal district court in Louisiana entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Patricia from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Patricia to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  Patricia also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance of any emergency relief.  On November 14, 2016, the trial court issued a judgment ordering Patricia to comply with the court's order, ordering her to reimburse Steven for the cost of replacing the boat's air conditioner, and ordering Patricia's to reimburse him for the boat slip fees.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Patricia consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering a temporary restraining order, and imposing a civil penalty of $100,000. The judgment also ordered Patricia to provide a copy of the complaint to the court for further determination by the court upon motion of the SEC. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael R. Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New Orleans Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New Orleans, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Louisiana Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
