  "summary": "On May 2, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment ordering the reinstatement of Timothy A. Wheeland to his position as Wildlife Maintenance Propagator.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that on January 27, 2017, the Game Commission closed the North Central Game Farm and furloughed Wheeland and five other members of the agency's Wildlife Services Division.  According to the complaint, Wheeland was one of the members of a committee that recommended the closure of the game farm.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that Wheeland agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains or halts his work as a Wildlife Service Division Chief, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  Wheeland also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years and to pay a $1.7 million civil penalty.  As part of the settlement, the Commission agreed to disgorge its ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, pay a civil penalty of $1,722, and pay an officer and director bar equal to the amount of his salary.  Finally, the court entered an order freezing Wheeland's assets, freezing his assets, and barring him from participating in any penny stock offering or offering a penny stock transaction.  On May 1, 2019, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office issued an order suspending Wheeland from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.    The Commission's complaint charges Wheeland with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and officer-and-director and penny stock bars against Wheeland.  Additionally, the complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of his assets with interest, and civil penalties against him.  For further information, see Press Release No. 17-20-2017."
