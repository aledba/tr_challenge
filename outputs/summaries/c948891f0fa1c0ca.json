  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Arthur Lawton Clark, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 12 months in prison for the 2014 shooting death of his brother-in-law, Sonny Barlow.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that Clark, who was convicted and sentenced after pleading guilty to aggravated animal cruelty for the death of Mr. Barlow, used a.22-caliber pistol in 2012 to kill Barlow's cat.  According to the complaint, when confronted by Barlow\u2019s mother, who confronted Clark about the incident, Clark replied, without provocation, that he did not have a gun.  Clark also allegedly told the mother that he had used the pistol in self-defense, believing that he was about to attack her dog.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against Clark.  On May 12, 2015, Clark went to the Barlow residence to see his mother and to bring her some lunch.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, Clark confronted his mother with raised voices and asked her to leave the house.  Instead, Clark allegedly pushed her against a door and hit her, causing her to trip on the back door threshold and fall onto the porch deck, hurting her leg.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Clark consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, Inc. (Advisers) and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  Additionally, Clark agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in violation of the federal securities laws, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
