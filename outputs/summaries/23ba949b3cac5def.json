  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, N.J., alleges that, on June 21, 2018, Tyhan Brown, a convicted felon and convicted felon, made three Facebook posts in which he called a witness a \"rat\" and called for someone to shoot him. According to the complaint, the defendants' posts were not intended to be a threat to the witness, but rather to induce others to do violence. In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants made the posts on the day of Brown's conviction and the day after he was sentenced to prison for the same conduct. The complaint further alleges that defendant made three more Facebook posts the next day, each of which contained the defendant's own personal and/or \"well-grounded suspicion\" that he intended to harm the witness or agents involved in the alleged cyber-harassment. The court found probable cause to hold defendant liable for a civil injunctive action and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Brown. The SEC also announced that it was seeking a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against Brown, as well as an officer-and-director bar against him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  On August 29, 2019, the court granted the SEC's request for a preliminary injunction and ordered Brown to be held in contempt of the court.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Brown consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, and orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest. The judgment also orders Brown to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $75,000, respectively.  A hearing on August 30, 2019 is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release Order No. 17-cv-01221 (2014).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by David A. Kasper of the New York Office of the Attorney General's Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
