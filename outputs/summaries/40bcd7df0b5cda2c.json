  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Romi Kimell, who was convicted of concealment money laundering in violation of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, in 2013 and 2014, the defendants stole over $300,000 in cash from a Florida home for the purpose of concealing a listed attribute of the stolen funds.  According to the complaint, while the defendants claimed to have used the stolen money to support their lavish lifestyle, the complaint alleges that instead of using the stolen cash to conceal the true source of the funds, they deposited it into a locked closet in the master bedroom of their North Andover home.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Braune on the same day that he was sentenced to prison for money laundering.  As set forth in the SEC's Complaint, Braune violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Complaint\u00c2\u00a0and in the Commission's Order\u00c2\u00a017(a) and (c) Rules 206(3) and 206 (4) thereunder of the Exchange Act, the registration provision of Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  Braune has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000 and a $100,000 civil penalty, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 566, 567, 566-4, and (8) (A) (B) (C) (D) (Securities Act) (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rules 5b-20, 13a-1, 13b2-2, and 14a-13 thereunder (Exhibit A) and 14b-14 thereunder).  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David A. Kasper and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0"
