  "summary": "On January 17, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a medical malpractice action brought by the SEC.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albany, New York, on February 18, 2011, Jennifer Lasher Tinsmon spent the evening with her boyfriend, Daniel Despart, with the two ultimately returning to Despart's home around midnight.  As alleged in the complaint, Despart and his attorney attempted to subpoena the patient log and treatment records of the cardiac arrest patient.  The complaint alleges that the two defendants failed to timely consult a neurosurgeon about the patient's injuries and did not timely arrange for her transfer to AMCH.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Despart.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $10,000.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the Olsen defendants, charging them with violations of Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and aiding and abetting the defendants' violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John M. Burt and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by Jennifer L. Hershfang. The case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the New York Regional Office.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by David A. Cohen, Michael A. Kasper, and Glenn S. Gordon of the Boston Regional Office, with assistance from Eric R. Werner of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The examination was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The trial will be conducted by Messrs. Cohen and Gordon under the supervision of Amy C. McKinley. The court will determine the amount of monetary relief to be provided to the defendants."
