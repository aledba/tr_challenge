  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania yesterday granted summary judgment in favor of Dustin and Marcy Bogart in a related action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for Pennsylvania.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that the Bogarts violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Dustin Bogart was the rightful owner of the property and that he had used several UBTOs to hide his income.  In its complaint, the complaint alleges that Dustin and his wife, Marcy, falsely claimed that the property was theirs and that they were entitled to a share of the proceeds.  Instead, as the complaint alleged, the defendants used the property to conceal their ownership and assets from the government and to pay off the mortgage for the property in 2005 and the property taxes in 2006.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties and to be barred from serving as officers or directors of any state-registered business trust organization (UBTO).  The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 7403(b).  In a parallel action, the District Court issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the Defendants, and ordering them to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest.   The Court also ordered the Defendants to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of their disgorgements. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by David Bierbrauer and supervised by Marc Blau of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Rogers and Ms. Blau. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
