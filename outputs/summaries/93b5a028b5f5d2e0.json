  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment in favor of the tax commissioner, finding that Kinnear was entitled to a tax exemption based on the increase in the assessed value of a property that has undergone or is undergoing environmental cleanup.  According to the court's order, on January 1, 2012, Kinnear's property was acquired by Lennox Flats Apartments, L.L.C., and the property was used for the manufacture and repair of industrial magnets.  The court found that the property did not qualify for the exemption under R.C. 5709.87, and that it was not subject to the exemption as required by the federal tax laws.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Secretary of State's Office today announced that it had issued an exemption to Kinnear for the purpose of remediation of the property.  On March 25, 2013, the Tax Commissioner granted an exemption of $396,000 to the property owner, verifying that he had remediated the property in compliance with applicable environmental standards and that the building had no value to assess on the prior year's tax-lien date.  Without admitting or denying the BTA's findings, the tax Commissioner consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins Kinnear from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Kinnear to pay disgorgement of $4,076,000 plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Finally, the court granted Kinnear a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from making or selling any investments in any real estate that is subject to remediation, and from participating in any offering of a penny stock in a public offering of any penny stock. The court also ordered Kinnear not to participate in any offerings of penny stock until after the SEC's final determination on the subject of the exemption was issued.  As a result of this order, the exemption for the apartment buildings in question has been waived, and Kinnear has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to a five-year exemption from liability under the federal securities laws. The final judgment also requires Kinnear, as an individual, to show cause and effect in a civil proceeding. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Ohio Office of Inspector General and the Division of Enforcement's Retail Strategy Task Force. The litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica and Mr."
