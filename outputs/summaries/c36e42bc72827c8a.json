  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Sheila Elliott, a Dallas, Texas-based paramedic education consultant, for breach of contract.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, alleges that Elliott violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  According to the complaint, from July 2014 through November 2015, Elliott made numerous false statements to regulators and accreditors in connection with her work with the Paramedic Advisory Committee.  In one instance, she allegedly provided false information about the number of students enrolled in the training courses before Elliott's disclosures.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, that Elliott gave up her TCPA rights when she signed the NDAs.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the complaint and in a subsequent motion to dismiss, Elliott consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay disgorgement of $1,038,078, plus prejudgment interest of $2,065, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Elliott has also agreed to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  On June 29, 2016, the court granted a motion for summary judgment against Elliott, ordering her to be enjoined from violating the federal anti-fraud provisions, and ordering a permanent injunction against her from violating those provisions.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David M. Welshhans and Eric R. Werner of the Fort Worth Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Department of State Health Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Dallas Police Department, the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Texas Secretary of State's Office.
