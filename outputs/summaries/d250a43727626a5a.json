The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that Gurnoe was appointed as petitioner\u2019s limited guardian by the court in July 2016 and appointed as a conservator and limited guardian in November 2016. The complaint alleges that, from the outset of the PPO proceedings, respondent had exerted control over petitioner, manipulated her, had a history of predatory behavior in his relationship with her, and had reinserted himself into her daily life. According to the complaint, petitioner had developed a short-term memory issues and had been asked to stop, and did for a while, but then he changed the passwords on her accounts and changed passwords. The SEC alleges that respondent was not complying with the court order to cease all contact with petitioner, and that he had threatened to commit any of the violent, threatening, or harassing prohibited acts listed in Section 600.2950(1) and (2). The complaint also alleges that petitioner had been threatened by Soren and others in her life, including a yoga instructor, a massage therapist, and a mutual friend, who had been with petitioner for over 40 years. In addition, the complaint alleged that respondent had been told that he was a \"good son,\" that he does not listen to her, that he has an ownership interest in an animal in which petitioner has a relationship, that she spent on average one to two nights a week at respondent's home and that she had a video chat with petitioner on one occasion in March 2015 while she was drinking a glass of wine and appeared intoxicated although she was an infrequent drinker.
