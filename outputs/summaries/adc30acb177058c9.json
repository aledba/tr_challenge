  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against Riverport Insurance Company, Inc., a North Carolina-based insurance company, for its role in a 2014 automobile accident.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that Riverport violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its order, the SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  According to the SEC's order, filed on February 29, 2016, Riverport agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commission's order. The settlement, which is subject to court approval, reserves the issue of permanent injunctive relief and the amount of any civil monetary penalties to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  On March 5, 2017, the Honorable Doreen L. Gibson of the United States District Court in Charlotte issued a temporary restraining order, ordering Riverport to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and ordering the company to pay an $8,500 civil penalty and a $100,000 penalty. The SEC previously issued an order freezing Riverport's assets and imposing a $10 million civil penalty against the company.  This settlement is pending final approval by the Court of Appeals.   The Commission's investigation was conducted by David Becton and Eric R. Werner of the Atlanta Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U. S. Attorney's Office for North Carolina and the Department of Justice in this matter."
