  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Wellness Corporate Solutions, Inc., a Kansas-based company that provided on-site biometric screenings for healthcare professionals.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Wellness violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to pay its obligations under the MSA.  According to the complaint, Wellness agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint.  Wellness also agreed to pay $1.00 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of the company's profits.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the company.  On May 6, 2016, the court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered the company to pay a $2.5 million civil penalty.  As alleged in the Complaint, however, this settlement does not apply to Wellness's breach of contract.  Instead, the Court found that the company violated the contract and, in the alternative, that it could not recover any of the alleged ill-gotten gains from the alleged breach.   The court also ordered Wellness to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Jennifer Silverman and supervised by Marc Blau of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Silverman. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the Office of the United States Secretary of State."
