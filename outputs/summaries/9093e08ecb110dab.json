  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Michael Quinn Sullivan for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Sullivan failed to register as a lobbyist in 2010 and 2011, when he was the President of Empower Texans, a non-profit corporation that \"educates and inspires\" Texans to exercise effective citizenship and to hold their elected officials accountable through their use of research, reporting, and advocacy.  According to the complaint, Sullivan then filed an amended pleading in district court for trial de novo, alleging that the Commission violated the registration provisions of chapter 305 of the federal securities laws and that Sullivan was liable for a civil penalty of $10,000.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Sullivan.  On May 3, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Sullivan, charging him with violating the registration provision of Section 305. The SEC also charged Sullivan with violating Section 5 of the Texas Securities Act of 1933.  Sullivan has agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  To learn more about the Commission's investigation, see Litigation Release No. 571 (Aug. 5, 2015).  The Commission's complaint, filed in federal district court in Dallas, Texas, charges Sullivan with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1), and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The complaint also names Sullivan as a defendant in an administrative proceeding that is subject to court approval. The Commission has also agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Sullivan from future violations of Section 5, and orders him to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  A hearing on the Commission\u2019s motion has been scheduled for November 5, 2018.  An SEC hearing on November 6, 2018 is scheduled for 11:30 a.m. Eastern."
