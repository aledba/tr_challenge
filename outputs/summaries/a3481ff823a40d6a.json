  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Glenn E. Estess, Jr., as personal representative of the estate of Lecil V. Thomas; Richard E. \"Lecil\" Thomas; Thomas' common-law wife; and Thomas' two surviving sons, Roger E. and Richard V. (hereinafter collectively referred to as \"the appellees\").  According to the court's order, Estess and Harbin filed a petition in the probate court for a share of LECil's estate pursuant to \u00a743-2-350, the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for a summary judgment against them.  The court also found that Estess violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act by failing to consider Harbin's motion for summary judgment.  In its order, the court also ordered Estess to comply with the entry of a judgment ordering him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus interest.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Judge Estess has agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1, and orders him to disgorge $1,000, which he has already paid to Harbin, and to pay a $100,000 civil penalty.  On May 14, 2014, the Honorable Margaret S. McCreary of the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals entered a judgment against Estess that permanently barred him from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The court granted the court-ordered injunction, ordered a temporary restraining order, and ordered the payment of a $1 million civil penalty to be determined by the court at a later date. The order also prohibits Estess from participating in any civil proceeding with respect to a nominee for a penny stock bar. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.
