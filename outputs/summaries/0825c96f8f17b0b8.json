  "summary": "On March 17, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California entered a final judgment in favor of the three entities that filed for bankruptcy protection in 2016.  The court found that the defendants were liable for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions related to their role in causing global warming.  According to the court's order, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also found that defendants were not liable for liability under Section 3479 of the Exchange Act, and that their causes of action did not arise from the conduct of their mining operations.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their ill-gotten gains.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Western District of Missouri today announced criminal charges against one of the defendants. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Francisco, charges the defendants with violating the anti-fraud provision of Section 13(b)(5)(A) and 13(c) thereunder, and seeks injunctive relief, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction against future violations and a penny stock bar against the defendants, as well as an officer and director bar against Appellants. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On March 24, 2018, a federal district court in California entered an order enjoining the defendants from violating the above-mentioned provisions, ordering the defendants to disgorge their alleged losses, and ordering the companies to pay a $1.2 million civil penalty. The settlements are pending final approval by the court.  An SEC order appointing a receiver to oversee the receivership of the companies' assets is pending approval by a federal court.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the SEC's San Francisco Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The Commission on Environmental Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
