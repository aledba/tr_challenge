  "summary": "On June 26, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Maryland entered a final judgment against a Maryland man who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for selling and distributing heroin.  The court held that, as alleged in the complaint, Patrick Joseph Thomas, 23, of Ocean Pines, Maryland, was liable for involuntary manslaughter based on his conduct in connection with the sale of heroin to a 16-year-old boy who died of an overdose.  According to the court's order, Thomas was the only person in the family who had ever been convicted of a felony for selling or distributing heroin, and he had no prior experience with the drug.  Thomas allegedly used the same amount of heroin as Colton, but with a different set of risks.  In a parallel case, the Court of Special Appeals found that, in 2015, Colton had overdosed on heroin and had been found to be suffering from an acute opioid addiction.  As alleged, the court found that Thomas violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Thomas consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $10,000.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Baltimore Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Maryland Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Maryland Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
