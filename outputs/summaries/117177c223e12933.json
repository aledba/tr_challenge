  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered final judgments against the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs in favor of Babb, a clinical pharmacist at the C.W. \u201cBill\u201d Young VA Medical Center in Bay Pines, Florida. Babb alleges that her managers discriminated against her based on her gender and age, retaliated against her because she had engaged in protected EEOC activity, and subjected her to a hostile work environment. According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Tampa, Florida, Babb was one of two pharmacists who were denied access to training opportunities because they were \"never happy, always complaining,\" and were not hired for the anticoagulation position. The complaint further alleges that one of those pharmacists once asked her, \u201cWhen do you retire?\u201d while speaking to Babb during an investigation of a vulgar email she sent to a colleague. The SEC alleges that Babb replied, \"I'm tired of being discriminated against because I'm older and female.\u201d The SEC's final judgment against Babb permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Babb to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Babb also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Florida Department of Health and Human Services, and the Florida Office of Inspector General in this matter."
