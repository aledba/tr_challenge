  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Orleans today entered a final judgment against defendant Lance Cowans, who was arrested on February 1, 2015, for his role in an alleged drug ring that targeted Houston residents.  According to the court's order, Cowans consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  The court also granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against Cowans.  In its order, the court also ordered Cowans to comply with the entry-by-law provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, Williams agreed to a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  On May 8, 2017, the SEC filed an emergency action against the officers, charging Cowans with violating Section 15(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 5b2-1 and Rule 15a-3 thereunder. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Orleans, charges Cowans and Williams with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-3 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder and seeks permanent injunctions, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future.
