  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and three mining companies for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Haines, Alaska on December 4, 2017, alleges that, under the federal securities laws, the federal government is required to consider the impact of mining development on public lands. Specifically, the complaint alleges that BLM failed to adequately consider the potential impacts of potential mining development when it issued its final environmental impact statement (EA) for the Palmer Project Area and Road Extension. The complaint further alleges that the BLM's failure to consider these impacts as part of the environmental review for the two projects was unreasonable because the agency had not adequately evaluated the potential impact of development on the public lands at issue.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against defendants Alyu Mining Co., Inc., Constantine North, LLC, and others for their roles in the alleged violations.  According to the SEC's order, the defendants agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement is pending final approval by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David A. Cohen and supervised by Scott A. Thompson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, and the Alaska Secretary of State's Office.\u00c2\u00a0Investors can quickly and easily check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov.
