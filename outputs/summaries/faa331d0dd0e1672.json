  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a temporary restraining order against Shari Bishop and her husband, David Michael Craig, in connection with an alleged domestic abuse case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that Shari and David Craig violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Shari told her husband that she was going to have him kill David and Jerry Cummings and that she wanted to have Jerry and David Cummings killed as revenge for prior incidents of abuse by David and David.  Shari also allegedly told her father that she would have him \"watch\" her children when they were in distress.  She also claimed that David and Shari were being abused by a biker gang member who was in possession of an AR-15 rifle.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced that it filed criminal charges against the defendants for their roles in the alleged scheme.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and orders Shari to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,500.00.  Additionally, the court granted Shari's request for an emergency court order against David, ordering her to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, and ordering her return to her husband.  On August 23, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a court-ordered restraining order, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar against David. The SEC also issued an order suspending Shari from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  A hearing scheduled for September 5, 2019, was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. for Shari, David, and David to be interviewed by an independent court-appointed evaluator, who would determine the appropriate course of action for each of the defendants based on the facts of the case. The hearing was conducted by Norman J. Singer and Shambie Singer of the New Orleans Regional Office, and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Gibson, and the case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Police Department, the Internal Revenue Service, the FBI, the Texas State Attorney General's Office"
