  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina today announced criminal charges against a North Carolina State Trooper for lying to his supervisor about losing his hat during a routine traffic stop.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina on January 29, 2018, alleges that Trooper Wetherington, then a trooper with the State Highway Patrol, misappropriated a hat from his patrol vehicle and concealed the loss of it from his supervisor.  According to the complaint, after learning that the hat had been lost during a traffic stop, he confronted his supervisor and told her that he had lost it.  He also allegedly told his supervisor that he did not know what happened to the hat and that he placed it on the trunk lid of the truck, the boat, or behind the light bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the trooper consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the North Carolina Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action against Petitioner for violating the above-mentioned provisions of the truthfulness policy, and that it is seeking a permanent injunction against further violations of that policy, as well as an officer-and-director bar against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future.  On March 29, 2009, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of South Carolina against Trooper R. Lee, alleging that he was falsely told by a state trooper that he lost his hat while on duty and that a truck ran over his hat.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, however, this was not the case.  Rather, the complaint alleges that Col. Grey violated the duty to protect the integrity of the state trooper by failing to adequately consider the facts and circumstances of the trooper's conduct.  To learn more about officer and director bar, see Press Release No. 598 (2014).  The complaint also alleges that, in the course of his investigation, Col.Grey provided false testimony to the Commission on Inspector General's Inspections and Examinations, including that he reviewed the record of a trooper who had been suspended by the agency in 2009 and found that the trooper had engaged in unacceptable personal conduct. The Commission also found that there was no reasonable cause for the trooper to be terminated"
