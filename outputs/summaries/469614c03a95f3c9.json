  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky on February 14, 2019 entered a final judgment against a Kentucky-based company and its former CEO in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Louisville, Kentucky, alleges that James Swinford was injured on the job on March 10, 2016, when he was performing heavy equipment maintenance work on a bulldozer. According to the complaint, after the work-related injury, he had what he described as a \u201ccrick\u201d in his neck and was able to mow the yard or comparable tasks without restrictions. The complaint alleges that after the injury, Swinfford had a prior cervical fusion surgery in the 1990s which resulted in chronic numbness and pain in his right hand and neck and a new onset of right arm numbness. The SEC also alleges that Dr. Strenge (Swinford\u2019s treating physician) acknowledged the work injury caused some worsening of both the neck pain and the right-arm numbness, and he recommended continued treatment.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the company.  On February 16, 2019, the SEC filed an emergency action and obtained a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze. The court granted the SEC's request for an emergency asset freeze and other emergency relief, including an officer-and-director bar, and ordered the company to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the company consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 597 (Feb. 13, 2019). The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kentucky Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
