  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Harvey Klinger, Inc., a Massachusetts-based literary agent, and its principal and CEO for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, Ms. Crowe was employed by the agency as an agent in Massachusetts when she resigned from the agency in August 2016.  The complaint alleges that, while she was employed, the agency stopped paying her commissions on deals related to authors she had brought to the agency, regardless of whether she continued to be employed.  As alleged in the complaint, in violation of her employment contract, the defendants continued to pay her commissions upon her resignation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the complaint charges the defendants with violating Section 1404 of the federal securities laws and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against the defendants for their roles in the alleged violations of Section 15(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Rules 15a-1 and (4) and Rule 15b2-3 thereunder, and for aiding and abetting the defendants' violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder; and for violating Section 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(d)(B)(2) and Rules 12b-20, 13d-1, 13a-11, and 14d-13 thereunder under Section 15A of the Exchange Act and Rules 16a-13 and 13d14 thereunder and under Rule 15e-1. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Basinger and Glenn S. Gordon of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by C.W. Downer and Mr. Klinger. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
