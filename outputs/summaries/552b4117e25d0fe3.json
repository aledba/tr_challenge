  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee today entered a final judgment in favor of the SEC's motion for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and other emergency relief.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Memphis, Tennessee, alleges that Daniel Schopmann, Ronald Meadows, and Jeremy Roach violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Schopman and Meadows solicited former RIG employees to join them in performing refractory services for RIG, and Roach assisted them in preparing a business forecast for the company.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Roach used the confidential information to solicit new employees, which he did not do because he had no legitimate reason to do so.  Roach also allegedly used the information to recruit new employees for his own business, and to solicit prospective customers.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000.  Additionally, the court granted the SEC request for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the charged sections of the securities laws, and ordered the SEC to conduct an examination of the alleged violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  On May 2, 2011, the Honorable Judge Robert C. Hannan of the United States District Court in Memphis granted the court-ordered injunction against Roach and others in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c).  The court also ordered the company to pay a civil penalty of $2,500, which will be determined by the court at a later date upon motion by the SEC.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (Feb. 21, 2011).  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Schopmacher, Meadows, Roach, and others.  A hearing is scheduled for May 24, 2011.
