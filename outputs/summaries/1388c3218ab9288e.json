  "summary": "On May 3, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado entered a final judgment against a former employee of Cherry Creek School District that permanently restrains her maintenance medical benefits.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, Jennifer Bolton, a former Cherry Creek employee, sustained admitted work-related injuries when she fell backwards to the ground, suffering low back pain, headache, and dizziness.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of this injury, she was unable to receive any maintenance medical benefit for a long period of time.  In addition, as alleged in the complaint, she developed a history of depression accompanied by anxiety, which caused a temporary exacerbation in her major depression and caused her to return to baseline.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s order, Bolton consented to the entry of the final judgment, which requires her to be reopening the claim, and requires her employer to pay for a lump sum for her permanent partial disability award.  As set forth in the order, the SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  On May 4, the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, ordered a hearing on the matter, and ordered a preliminary injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as an order appointing a receiver to oversee the reopening of the claim.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 8-43-303 (1).  The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Colorado Department of Insurance, and the Colorado Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
