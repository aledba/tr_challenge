  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois yesterday entered a judgment against Brenton F. Van Hoveln, a former Bloomington Police Officer, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 504(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on May 14, 2014, Brenton was hired as a police officer after his wife filed a petition for dissolution of marriage in 2012. The complaint alleges Brenton agreed to pay $356.33 per week in maintenance for 207 weeks, totaling $73,760.31. Brenton also agreed to be required to maintain health insurance for his wife.  The complaint also alleges that Brenton failed to pay a reasonable amount in child support and maintenance.  In a parallel action, on January 24, 2018, a federal district court in Chicago entered an order requiring the trial court to determine whether to grant a maintenance award to Brenton. The court found Brenton liable for violations of the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws and ordered him to pay an amount equal to the amount of his prior income.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court granted Brenton the right to a temporary restraining order, ordered Brenton to maintain his current job, and issued an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver's assets. The receiver was not named as a receiver, and the receiver was prohibited from making any payments to the receiver other than those owed to him by the receiver.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Illinois Department of Insurance in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
