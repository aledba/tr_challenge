  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio yesterday entered a final judgment against a defendant who was charged with felonious assault in connection with an April 2, 2016, party bus fight.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Cleveland, Ohio, alleges that James Caraballo, a resident of Edinboro, Pennsylvania, was the aggressor in a series of physical and verbal confrontations with a former high school friend who was also a defendant in the case.  According to the complaint, the defendants engaged in verbal and physical confrontations, including one in which the defendant allegedly kicked a co-defendant in the face and another in the head.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On June 5, 2019, the U. S. District Judge granted the SEC's request for an emergency asset freeze and a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $25,000 civil penalty. The court also granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval.
