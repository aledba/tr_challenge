  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment against Darlene Warren Smith, a former state employee of the Department of Health and Hospitals, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Port Arthur, Texas on June 5, 2017, Smith and her employer, Devin George, were charged with violating the anti-discrimination provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC alleges that, in addition to the alleged violations of the securities laws, Smith, George, and George were also charged with acting as unregistered brokers and brokers in connection with DHH's conduct.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants engaged in a pattern and practice of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation against Smith and George.  In one instance, the complaint alleges that Smith, who was promoted to Deputy Secretary of DHH in 2015, received a right-to-sue letter from DHH on August 19, 2015, for which she was not selected for a promotion.  After filing her second complaint in July 2016, the SEC found that Smith violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and that George violated Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15(b)(6) and Rule 15a-7 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) of The Securities Act of 1933.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in Smith's second complaint, George and George consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoins them from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.  On June 19, the court denied Smith's motion for a temporary restraining order, ordered her to return to the office of public health, and ordered George to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, ordered him to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, and barred him from serving as an officer or director of a public health organization.  A hearing scheduled for July 24, 2017 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221.
