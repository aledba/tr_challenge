Best, in an action that was unsealed on December 20, 2017.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Rule 206(3) and (4) thereunder.
