  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arkansas today entered a final judgment against Janet M. Smyth, a former resident of Fayetteville, Arkansas, for failure to mediate and to mediation in good faith.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Arkansas, alleges that Janet Smyth violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the court improperly dismissed Janet's contempt motion without requiring her to attend mediation.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, contrary to the court's order, Janet failed to participate in mediation when, as alleged, she had mediated issues that had been resolved pursuant to the July 2014 final agreed order.  Janet also alleges that the court violated its discretion in failing to rule on her motions to strike, for clarification, and for reconsideration when she filed her contempt motion in the same court.  On January 26, 2018, the SEC issued an order requiring the parties to submit to mediation within ten days of filing their contempt motion for contempt, which is a violation of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Janet has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions, orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and requires her to submit a civil injunctive action against the defendant.  It also orders Janet to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000 and a $100,000 life-insurance policy with a $10,000 penalty, and to pay civil penalties of $150,000.  Additionally, the order requires Janet to show cause of action in the case before the court and to file a timely notice of appeal.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 564 S.W.3d 262 (March 23, 2011).  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Janet.  A hearing is scheduled for February 2, 2018 to determine whether to unseal the criminal charges and determine the amount of monetary relief to be obtained from Janet and her husband.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the SEC Enforcement Division's Fort Worth Regional Office, with assistance from Scott A. Williams of the Division of Justice's Office, and was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Fort Worth Division of Criminal Justice.   The litigation will be led by"
