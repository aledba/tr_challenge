  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against China-based law firm Yuhas, Ehrlich & Ardell, APC, which represented Silke Schulz and her four young children.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, China, Hong Kong, and Hong Kong on March 1, 2012, China's former president and co-owner of Asia Today Airlines, Ian Herzog, raised the issue of attorney fees in a class action settled by the court in 2012.  The complaint alleges that the court improperly allocated $18,125,000 in attorney fees to Silke, her four adult daughters from a previous marriage, and Asia Today, which hired Herzog to represent them in the case.  As alleged in the complaint, the court did not consider whether the attorney fees were reasonable, and instead awarded Herzog 10 percent of the settlement proceeds as attorney fees.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against Herzog.  On March 2, 2016, a federal district court in California issued a judgment ordering China to pay $18.125 million in civil penalties against China, and ordering the payment of a $1.2 million civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, China consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins China from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the Chinese to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined at a later date.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Schulz. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Chinese Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
