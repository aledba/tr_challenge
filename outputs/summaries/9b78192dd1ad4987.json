  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin today entered a final judgment against defendant Angel Mercado on all three counts of first-degree sexual assault of a child for having sexual contact with a child under the age of twelve.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Mercado, ordering him to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Madison, Wisconsin on January 23, 2009, Mercado consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The judgment also prohibits Mercado from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the admission of the videos.  Mercado also agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Section 908.08(2)(b) and (3) the reporting provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule\u00c2\u00a0206(4)-8 thereunder, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced that it filed a parallel criminal action.  On January 24, 2017, the court entered a judgment ordering Mercado to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and pay a civil penalty of $25,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Wisconsin Department of Justice, and the U. S. Attorney\u2019s Office."
