  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Syrus Systems, LLC (Syrus), a California-based company that was wrongfully terminated on January 26, 2010.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that Syrus violated the antifraud provisions of Section 425 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, in 2011, Syrus filed a civil injunctive action against Kurz, alleging that Kurz had maliciously prosecuted a meritless claim for unemployment insurance benefits that terminated in Syrus's favor when the SEC found that the claim was not meritless.  In a parallel action, on May 27, 2011, a federal district court in California issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of Syrus, and ordering the company to pay a civil penalty of $15,000.  On July 9, 2012, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary injunction, ordered the company's assets to be frozen, and ordered Syrus to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the company consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Syrus from violating the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  Syrus also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any action or proceeding that is subject to court approval.  Separately, the SEC has issued an order suspending the company from issuing or selling any security, including the right to reapply after five years of service, and imposing a conduct-based injunction against any alteration of the company or its policies or procedures.  As part of the settlement, Syrus agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 5(a) and 5(c) and to pay civil penalties of $20,000 and $10,000, respectively, for each of those violations.  Syrus also agreed not to be associated with any company or individual liable for liability arising from a malicious prosecution action arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  Finally, the settlement is pending final approval by the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5,"
