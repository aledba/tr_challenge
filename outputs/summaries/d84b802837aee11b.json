  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Illinois on July 1, 2017, entered a final judgment against a New York-based attorney who filed a civil injunctive action in federal court in Chicago against a former state attorney for the former Yugoslavia.  According to the court's order, Misetic, who was assigned to the prosecutor's office for the then-Tribunal of Yugoslavia, had a blog called \"Misetic Law,\" which claimed that Misetic was a \"citizen of Illinois\" who, as part of his legal practice, had an Illinois law license. Misetic allegedly wrote in blog postings from 2013 and 2015 that Robertsson had falsified evidence in the Gotovina trial and should have been criminally prosecuted for obstruction of justice.  Misetic also alleged that in one of his blog postings, Robertsson wrote that he had \"no systematic and continuous contacts with Illinois.\"  The court also ruled that, based on the nature of the alleged misconduct and criminal activity, the amount of Misetic's alleged contact with Illinois was insufficient to establish the minimum contacts needed for general jurisdiction in Illinois.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Misetic.  The SEC's complaint charges Misetic with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On July 2, 2018, the U. S. District Judge in Chicago issued a temporary restraining order, ordering Misetic to surrender his Illinois-based law license, and appointing a service-of-the-govt agent to assist him in this matter. The order also prohibits Misetic from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in any jurisdiction, including securities in the securities industry. The court granted Robertsson's motion for a preliminary injunction, ordering him to comply with the court order, and ordered him to sign an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receiver.  Robertsson agreed to the appointment of a service of the state attorney, and agreed to pay $5,000,"
