  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a preliminary injunction against the City of Chicago for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that the Chicago City Attorney's Office improperly issued a temporary restraining order and issued a cease-and-desist order to certain members of the Chicago Evangelism Team who regularly circulate petitions in the Park.  According to the complaint, the City's new rules prohibit the dissemination of religious and petition-related literature in the park.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in adopting the new rules, the city violated the First Amendment by failing to adequately evaluate the impact of the restrictions on the participants' free speech and the public's enjoyment of the Park, including by prohibiting the use of the public square as a \"safe space.\"  The complaint also alleges that City Attorney General Eric Schneiderman violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the City violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Schneiderman consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 206 and 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\"), and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a $1,000,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (2014).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Police Department, and the Illinois Department of State's Office of Criminal Investigations."
