  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Ford Global Technologies, LLC, an automotive body parts manufacturer, against ABPA.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that Ford violated the antifraud provisions of the federal design patents.  According to the complaint, ABPA and its members raised the issue of whether Ford could properly claim its designs as applied to the entire F-150 truck when it sold the truck.  ABPA's complaint alleges that, in reality, Ford's designs for the hood and headlamp were not subject to a design patent because they were not functional and could not be used with Ford's trucks.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced that it would order Ford to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Ford consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the design patents, and orders it to pay disgorgement of $2.3 million, prejudgment interest of $100,000, and a civil penalties of $500,000.  Ford agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction, which is subject to court approval.   The settlement is pending final approval by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
