  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Montana today entered a final judgment against Adam Hatfield, a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for the purpose of recovering stolen property.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Montana, alleges that, from mid-December through mid-January 2016, Adam was unlawfully barred from appearing as a trial witness in connection with a multi-year criminal case.  According to the complaint, Adam, who lives in Butte-Silver Bow County, Montana, was not permitted to participate in the jury selection process because he was not present at the time of the trial.  Adam also alleges that the District Court failed to record all of Adam\u2019s conference calls and in-chambers discussions.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney General for Montana today announced criminal charges against Adam, charging him with violating the right to a fair trial, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, Adam consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, Inc. (\"Advisers\").  The judgment also prohibits Adam from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, other than to provide a copy of the complaint to the court as part of an expedited review of the matter.  It also bars Adam from appearing or practicing before a court as an attorney, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Sansone of the Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order against Adam and ordered Adam to comply with the court order, including that the court will determine whether to order him to appear or be removed from the case at a later date.  A hearing scheduled for June 5, 2018 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Montana State Attorney General's Office, and the Montana Office of Criminal Justice."
