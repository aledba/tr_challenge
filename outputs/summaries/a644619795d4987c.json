  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands today entered a final judgment against Lili and Francisco Tydingco, who are charged with harboring an illegal alien and aiding and abetting the harboring, in violation of the federal criminal laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that, in September 2013, Lili met X.N.\u2019s father, who asked Lili to take her home with him to attend school in the United States. The complaint alleges that Lili provided the father with an I-94 with a mandatory departure date of November 4, 2013, yet she kept X.n. in her home until 2015.  Lili also allegedly told the father that she had a student visa booked for October 28, 2013 within the 45-day window before an alien may \u201cparole in\u201d to the country.  According to the complaint, the father told Lili that he would give her a place to live long after her parole period ended and that she would be able to afford shelter to her.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar against them.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Mascianica entered final judgments permanently enjoining Lili from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also ordered the SEC to pay civil penalties in the amount of $20,000, $10,000 and $1,500, respectively, to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations and a return of the charged aliens.  A hearing has been scheduled for May 26, 2018.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Cottrill and Ms. Werner. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
