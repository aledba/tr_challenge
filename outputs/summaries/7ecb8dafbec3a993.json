  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against Larry Ervin, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to three years of double jeopardy for his role in a February 2017 carjacking that left at least one person injured.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, alleges that, on February 26, 2017, Ervin stopped his truck in the middle of the intersection and shot at Hines, who was trying to help his neighbor with a car repair.  According to the complaint, the truck was littered with bullets.  Ervin allegedly told the driver that he had \"started firing rounds at [the truck] because he thought he was going to be hit by a fresh vehicle accident.\"  The complaint further alleges that Ervin told the dispatcher that he was defending his property when he approached Hines' truck with the gun pointed at the truck, and that he did not see anyone in reasonable fear of death or great bodily harm when he fired the gun.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the driver of the Kia Sorento, who had been driving the truck at the time, was not following Ervin when he shot the truck.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's Complaint, the court agreed with the SEC that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Ervin to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The court also denied the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order, which requires the court to determine whether a defendant has been subjected to double jeopardy by virtue of his or her prior felony convictions.  On March 2, 2018, the U. S. District Judge in Indianapolis granted the defendants the right to return their allegedly stolen automobiles and to have their vehicles inspected by an independent examination team that included a forensic examination of the truck's interior.  To determine whether the jury had sufficient evidence to determine that a defendant had been liable for double jeopardy, the SEC requested a preliminary injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against Ervin from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, sale, or promotion of any firearm, including a gun, and a penny stock bar against him. The court granted the request for a permanent injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws, ordered the jury to consider the merits of the case, and imposed a penalty of $1,000,000.
