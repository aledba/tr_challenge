  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder, three counts of use of a deadly weapon to commit a felony, and one count of possession of a firearm.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Omaha, Nebraska on August 17, 2016, Derrick U. Stricklin, a convicted felon, was falsely told by a confidential informant that he was going to obtain a gun because he was having problems with two black men who he recognized from prior visits to Morales' shop.  The complaint alleges that, after learning the confidential informant had told him that he wanted to obtain firearms, he called him and asked his counsel to show him a picture of the two men.  As alleged in the complaint, however, this was not sufficient for the defendant to convince the court to grant him postconviction relief without an evidentiary hearing.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Nebraska today announced criminal charges against Sticklin.  On August 24, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, which seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $1,000,000 and a $100,000 civil penalty, and bars him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Nebraska Department of Justice in this matter."
