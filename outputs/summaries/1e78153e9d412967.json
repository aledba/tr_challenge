  "summary": "On May 26, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Sandaro Realty, Inc. and its general contractor, E.W. Howell Co., LLC, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, Sandaro and Howell failed to establish, prima facie, that Bay Structures, Inc., a subcontractor on the project, had authorized McDonnell to use a particular scaffold on which he fell, and that, on the date of his fall, the scaffold had been disassembled almost immediately after McDonnell's fall and the broken plank was discarded.  The court also ordered Sandaro to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Sandaro agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in its motion, which was filed in federal district court in Manhattan.  In its order, the court also denied Sandaro's motion for a preliminary injunction, ordering it to pay civil penalties of $2,500, and ordering that Sandaro disgorge its allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest of $600,000 and pay a $500,000 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000 in disgorgement, $1.5 million in pre-judgment interest, and a $1 million civil penalty.  On May 24, 2016, the Court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, and ordered the SEC to determine whether to proceed with its litigation.  As part of the settlement, the SEC agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Sandaro from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders Sandaro, Howell, and Sandaro not to violate those provisions. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael W. Welshhans and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Florida, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
