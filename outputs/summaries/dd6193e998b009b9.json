  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment against defendant Mauricio Garcia Gomez on two counts of assault in the second degree.  The court entered the final judgment in favor of Garcia Gomez, who was previously convicted of two felony counts of domestic violence.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle on September 1, 2015, Garcia Gomez was charged with two felony acts of assault for which he was not unanimous in agreeing to a guilty verdict.  Garcia Gomez allegedly used a pocketknife to hit his mother, who had been in the apartment at the time of the alleged assault.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendant had been physically and sexually abusive toward his mother since at least 2011, and had been using a knife and a whip to hit her in the face and arms for more than a week.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Garcia Gomez had been verbally and physically abusive toward C.G. since 2011, when he was arrested by the Seattle Police Department for a second-degree assault and later charged with a third-degree felony for the same conduct.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering Garcia Gomez to pay a civil penalty of $500,000, a $100,000 officer-and-director bar, and a $250,000 civil penalty.  On October 30, 2016, the court granted Garcia Gomez a temporary restraining order and ordered him to surrender his passport.  After the court's order was entered, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Garcia Gomez charging him with violating the due process provisions of the federal securities laws.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Seattle Office of Inspector General, and the U. S. Attorney\u2018s Office for the Southern District of New York."
