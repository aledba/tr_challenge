  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a mother who filed an emergency action to terminate her parental rights.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, alleges that C.E.C. III (the father) filed a notice of appeal on August 31, 2017, alleging that the mother had abandoned their son, A.B.C., and attempted to file an emergency court-ordered notice of appealing on August 30, 2017.  According to the complaint, the mother was told that she had to file her notice of application by 4:28 and 52 seconds, and that she could not file it until the clerk's office closed.  In reality, the court had already issued a judgment on August 16, 2017 that terminated the mother's parental rights to the child.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed by the mother in August 2017, the Court of Civil Appeals held that, pursuant to Rule 4(a)(1) and (3) of the Alabama Rules of Juvenile Procedure, a timely filing of an appeal is required by the court.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Complaint and the Court's Order, the Judge granted the court's motion for a temporary restraining order against the mother from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and ordered the court to consider the merits of the case.  On September 6, 2018, a federal district court in Alabama issued an order requiring the mother to file a timely response to her application for a court order suspending her from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for August 29, 2018.  To learn more about timely filing, see Press Release No. 17-cv-01-2017 (Aug. 30, 2018).  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Alabama today announced criminal charges against the father and charged him with violating Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Exchange Act Rules 10b2-1 thereunder, and charges the mother with violating Rule 5(e).  The court also ordered the father to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000, and to pay a $75,000 officer and director bar.   The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, and Amy C. Welshhans of the Atlanta Regional Office."
