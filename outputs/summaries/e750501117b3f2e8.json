  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., alleges that the EPA violated the federal securities laws by failing to follow the agency's policy of uniformity. The complaint also alleges that, in violation of Section 7601 of the Exchange Act, EPA violated Rule 78(a)(2) and (c) thereunder, and that, as a result of those actions, the agency was unable to respond to a federal court order requiring it to do so.  In addition, the complaint alleges that EPA failed to adequately consider the role of the federal courts in determining the appropriate course of action for the agency.  According to the complaint, the SEC's final judgment, which permanently enjoins the agency from violating these federal laws, orders the agency to comply with Rule 78a-1, and orders it to submit an amended rule to the court. The court will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 7607(b)(2).  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, a temporary restraining order, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of Section 7607. The SEC also seeks a preliminary injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent review of its compliance with Rule 7601. The case is being handled by Richard L. Revesz, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit, and Amy C. Welshhans, Regional Director of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by John R. Rymas and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Justice in this matter."
