  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment against a New Jersey attorney who was liable for a $127,277.05 legal malpractice judgment against him and his law firm.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, Barbara B. Boyd represented her husband, William L. Boyd, as a partner in a law firm that provided legal services to Barbuto. The complaint alleges that, from at least September 2010 through September 2015, Boyd & Boyd retained defendants to represent her in an Internal Revenue Service matter, and they \"committed malpractice in the course of representing\" her.  The complaint further alleges that defendant and W. Boyd were partners in the firm, and defendants were liable as a joint and severally liable for the firm's liability under Rule 4:40-1.  In its judgment, the court found that defendant was liable under Section 5(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 5d-8 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Barbara Boyd consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of her disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Lechler and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Ms. Boyd and Ms. DiProspero.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Attorney General's Office, and the New York Office of Financial Regulation."
