  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Texas resident Kerry Gittens in a parallel criminal case.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Gittens violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Gittens has agreed to settle the SEC's charges against him by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar against Gittens.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal prosecutions.  On September 28, 2016, Gittens was sentenced to fifty-years' confinement in the Institutional Division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.  As alleged in the complaint, the jury found Gittens guilty of the charged felony and ordered him to be permanently enjoined from further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933, and orders Gittens to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint Gittens consented to entry of the judgment and agreed to the imposition of permanent injunctions, to be subject to court approval of the settlement, and to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  He has also agreed to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any firearm, ammunition, or other controlled substance, and that he will not participate in the purchase, sale, or offer of a firearm without a reasonable basis to show that he is a reasonable person capable of acting in accordance with the facts of the matter.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint filed in federal court in Houston, on August 15, 2014 Gittens and his brother, Tyree Byrd, entered the room and demanded money from Gittens, telling Gittens that he was going to \"give it up.\" Gittens refused to comply with the order, and Gittens followed him out of the room. Gittens also allegedly threatened David with a gun, attempted to restrain Gittens with zip ties, and told Gittens \"don't play stupid.\" The SEC alleges Gittens did not respond to Gittens\u2019 requests for money, and neither Gittens nor Gittens were present at the time of the alleged robbery. The SEC also alleges that the defendants engaged in a pattern of aggressive, aggressive, and aggressive conduct that is consistent with the conduct of the defendants."
