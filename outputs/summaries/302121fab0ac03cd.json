  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on May 9, 2017, entered a final judgment against defendant David R. Rothenberg in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges that, as alleged in the complaint, from at least 2011 through 2016, the defendant possessed at least six images of a child who had been victimized by the child pornography abuser.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, the images of the child were disseminated widely on the internet, and many of the victims were victims of the abuse.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendant was a possessor of the images, a fact he told an undercover officer in an internet chat room.   The complaint further alleges that he was not responsible for the victims\u2019 losses, and that, despite having been ordered to pay restitution in the past, he did not share the images with the victims.  As a result of this conduct, the SEC is seeking a judgment that imposes a permanent injunction, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar from participating in the sale, purchase, sale, or promotion of child pornography, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and other relief.  On May 10, the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, ordered a hearing on the matter, and issued an order appointing a receiver to determine the amount of restitution to be paid to the victims, and ordered the receiver to provide a copy of the restitution order to the receiver.  To learn more about child pornography restitution, see Child Abuse and Abuse Education and Advocacy.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the New York Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Office of Inspector General, and the U.N. Office of Child Abuse."
