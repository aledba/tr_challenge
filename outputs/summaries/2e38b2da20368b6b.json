  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Anthony Livoti for his role in a Ponzi scheme that defrauded thousands of investors.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, charges Livoti with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that Livoti participated in a scheme to defraud investors by falsely assuring them that Mutual Benefits was financially sound and profitable, and that he was not involved in the scheme.  Livoti also alleges that the SEC improperly bolstered the credibility of one of his co-defendants, Steven Steiner, who was later called as a witness by the SEC.  According to the complaint, Livoti agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint and agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. DeLoach and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the Florida Office of the Secretary of State."
