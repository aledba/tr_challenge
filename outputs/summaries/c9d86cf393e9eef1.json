  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Terrence John McGovern, Jr., a California man who pleaded guilty to one count of possession of child pornography back in 2012. McGovern was sentenced to 30 months incarceration, a lifetime of supervised release, and a $12,500 civil penalty.  According to the court's order, McGovern consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal court in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on June 21, 2019.  The court also granted McGovern's request for a temporary restraining order, a conduct-based injunction, and an early termination of his supervised release.  McGovern also agreed to pay a civil penalty of a year and a day.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Puerto Rico today announced criminal charges against McGovern.  On June 18, 2019, the Honorable Gary A. Feess of the Central Division of California issued a final judgement that permanently enjoins McGovern from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders McGovern to pay $1,000 in disgorgement, $1.25 in prejudgment interest, and $100 in civil money penalties.  Without admitting to the allegations of the complaint, Mcgovern agreed to a permanent injunction, to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  After a hearing on June 19, 2020, Judge Feess issued an order suspending McGovern and ordering him to participate in a psychological or psychiatric treatment program as approved by the court.  He has agreed to the appointment of a receiver and to the payment of a $100,000 civil penalty in a parallel administrative proceeding.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the San Juan Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Public Finance Abuse Unit.
