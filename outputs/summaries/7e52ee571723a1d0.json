  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a correctional officer for his role in a recent insider trading scheme.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Francisco, alleges that Joseph Furtado, a former correctional officer at Centinela State Prison, was falsely told that he was able to use a side handle baton to disarm, subdue, and restrain an inmate.  Instead, according to the complaint, he was unable to use the baton because of a significant impairment in his left arm and hand, and he could not maintain adequate control over the inmate's baton.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as a result of his injury, he could no longer perform the essential functions of the correctional lieutenant position.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed on January 19, 2004, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (DOC) determined that Furtados was not qualified to perform the duties of a correctional lieutenant because he had failed two side-hand baton tests, which required him to use both hands and arms independently of each other.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint filed in the federal district court for New York, the DOC has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On February 21, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and the appointment of a receiver.  As part of the settlement, the department agreed to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and to a $20,000 officer-director and penny stock bar, and to pay an officer and director bar, as well as a $1,500 officer bar and a $100,000 administrative penalty.  Finally, the court granted the department's request for a writ of mandamus, which is subject to court approval, and ordered the institution to provide a copy of the final judgment to the receiver of the receiver, who will determine the amount of restitution to be paid by the receiver. The SEC also ordered the receiver to provide an accounting of all of the restitution that the receiver has already paid.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-20-17 (January 20, 2004).  The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry."
