  "summary": "On July 26, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia entered a final judgment against Michael Yang, a citizen of the People's Republic of China who was arrested in the United States on May 1-2 and attempting to transmit NDI to a foreign intelligence service.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleges that defendant Michael Yang was in the country at the time of the alleged transmission of NDI.  According to the complaint, Yang was interested in obtaining information on various issues involving National Defense Information (NDI) including the United Kingdom's THAAD missile defense system, the South China Sea, currency manipulation by the PRC, and public-private partnerships.  In its judgment, the court found that defendant had taken a substantial step toward transmitting NDI, including scanning the NDI onto an SD card at the FedEx store and hiding the SD card in his closet.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Yang consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws.  On July 24, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Yang, charging him with violating Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 and Exchange Act Rule\u00c2\u00a010b2(a) thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against further violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of this federal securities law, as well as an officer-and-director bar against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security measure in violation of Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder of the Exchange Act and Rules 206a-7, 206(8) and 207(9) of Exchange Act Rules 206(11)-8. The complaint also seeks a temporary restraining order against Yang and an order barring him from associating with any third party in connection with the alleged scheme.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 206 (4th Cir. 2010).  The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a security"
