  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of New Hampshire today entered a final judgment against the former supervisor of the New Hampshire Department of Information Technology (DOIT).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portsmouth, N.H., alleges that James Cole, a DOIT employee for fifteen years, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint also alleges that Cole violated the reporting requirements of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  According to the complaint, Cole was initially assigned a \"Wireless Access Point\" project, which required communication with customers who were requesting installation of a WAP, and coordination with persons who were to install the WAPs.  Cole ultimately performed eleven major revisions to the project, but the project took much longer to complete than anticipated.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General (OIG) today announced that it has issued an order suspending Cole from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years, ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and requiring him to return to work as a result of the oIG's action.  On May 26, 2016, the OIG issued Cole a second letter of warning, this time for conduct that did not meet any work standard under the federal reporting requirements.   The OIG's order temporarily suspended Cole from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Cole consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to comply with the Commission's order suspending him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, and sale of any securities in the United States, including the right to reapply after five years. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office, and the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office."
