  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Joseph Saint, a former construction crew member who was injured while working on a billboard in Erie County, New York.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that on the day of his injury, Joseph Saint was part of a three-person construction crew working to replace an advertisement on a New York City billboard.  According to the complaint, Saint was engaged in a routine maintenance work that required the attachment of custom-made wooden extensions to the billboard frame.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the crew member attempted to remove an old vinyl advertisement from the billboard by installing extensions that changed the shape of the billboard, which the court concluded constituted a significant alteration to the structure.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Saint consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 240(1) of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a conduct-based injunction. The court also granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar, and ordered the company to pay civil penalties of $1.5 million, $1 million, and $750,000, respectively.

The Commission's order also prohibits the Commission from imposing any monetary penalty against the individual or company responsible for the alleged violations of the Labor Law.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 240(3).  The Commission also issued an order requiring the Commission to conduct an independent examination of the work performed by the Commission on Safety and Health, including whether it is reasonable to believe that a person with a raised arm and a raised hand should be able to safely remove the offending piece of artwork from a building or structure. In a parallel action, the SEC today announced that it has obtained an order appointing a receiver to oversee the operation of the receiver. The receiver has agreed to the appointment of a receiver and to pay a $1,500,000 civil penalty.\u00c2\u00a0The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been"
