  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Belinda Isabel Quinonez, a Bakersfield, Calif., woman who was convicted of multiple felony offenses for punching a sheriff's deputy while she was in custody at the jail.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on December 1, 2016, defendant was arrested at the Central Receiving Facility for the purpose of recovering from a series of severe head injuries.  The SEC alleges that defendant, who was an amputee and confined to a wheelchair, began yelling and cursing at the deputies as she was being escorted to the cell.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants' actions were so aggressive and aggressive that the deputy's nose and chin were swollen and discolored.  At trial, the court found that defendant had suffered a significant amount of great bodily injury, including a broken nose and a deviated septum, and ordered her to have corrective surgery for the injured nose.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against defendant.  On December 2, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against defendant, charging her with violating Section 10-b of the Exchange Act, and with aiding and abetting defendant's violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Hinkle and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Corrections, and the California State Department of Health and Human Services."
