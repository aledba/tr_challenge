Bell, a professional photographer, Bigado Networks Inc., MJ Consulting Services, Inc., and EZ Ticket, LLC for copyright infringement.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, alleges that Bell violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Bell has agreed to settle the action by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $150,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $2,000.
