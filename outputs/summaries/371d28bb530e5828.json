  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of second-degree murder for stabbing and killing Andrew Wilson at the Inlet Inn in January of 2012.  The court found that the defendant was entitled to a new trial because, during the trial, the prosecutor openly suggested that if the jurors returned an erroneous verdict, this verdict would be corrected later by the courts.  According to the court's order, Adams agreed to the recommendation of the court, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, that the jury should decide whether to withdraw life support from a loved one at the close of the trial.  Adams also agreed that the court should consider whether the prosecutor had, in fact, misstated the law.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of New York today announced criminal charges against Adams.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Burt of the Umpqua Regional Office in New York granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Adams and ordered Adams to return to his hotel room to restate his criminal record.  Without admitting to the SEC\u2019s findings, Adams consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $25,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties he will pay in the future.   The SEC also issued an order suspending Adams from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering him to comply with a court order requiring him to show cause and effect in a case that requires him to be sentenced to a prison term of five years or less. \u00c2\u00a0 The SEC's order also prohibits Adams from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply as a result of a jury finding him guilty of a felony.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17.  This case was supervised by Jennifer C. Barry, Chief of the Alaska Division of Criminal Investigation."
