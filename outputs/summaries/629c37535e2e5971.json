  "summary": "On May 22, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana entered a final judgment against Tyree Harper, a parole violator who was placed on probation in California for a drug-related crime.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, Harper, who had been placed on parole following a felony conviction for possession of a firearm by a serious violent felon, agreed to submit to a warrantless search of his home for a storage unit that contained two batches of cocaine weighing 558.1 grams and 254.79 grams and twelve fake.12-gram oxycodone pills containing heroin.

Harper also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of one year from the date the criminal charge against him is filed, or from serving a sentence of 10 years or less, whichever is later.  On June 16, 2016, a sheriff's deputy stopped Knights and Simoneau near a PG&E gas line and observed pipes and gasoline in Simoneau's pickup truck; he later returned without those items. The court granted the request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the officer from conducting any search of a person or property under the supervision of a parole officer, and ordered the officer to conduct a search of the person and residence of the probation violator. The judge granted the motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws, ordered a conduct-based injunction against future violations, and appointed a receiver for the receiver of the receiver.
