  "summary": "The Estate of Justin Reeder, who was last seen with Jacob Lane, has agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, on October 17, 2016, the Estate filed a motion to intervene in the Keziah criminal case, requesting to be made a party and asserting its interest in $120,000 of the seized funds. The Estate also alleged that the court improperly granted summary judgment based on the doctrine of res judicata, which bars defendants from relitigating a previously adjudicated cause of action and orders the parties to file a separate civil action.  In a parallel action, on May 1, 2017, the Boyd Circuit Court, Criminal Division, denied the Estate\u2019s request to intervene and, in a separate order, ruled the estate had no standing to file an appeal.  On January 23, 2018, the trial court issued two orders requiring the Estate to comply with its earlier findings.  Two days after the court issued the orders, the estate filed a second civil action, alleging that it was never served with the requested summary judgment and that it failed to timely respond to its request for an extension of time.   The SEC alleges that, in its judgment, the court incorrectly granted the Estate a temporary restraining order and ordered it to pay $123,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Court also denied the estate a permanent injunction and ordered the estate to pay a $20,000 civil penalty, which the Estate agreed to pay in a civil action and a $100,000 penalty. The court also issued an order suspending the Estate from appearing before the SEC as an attorney or practicing before the Commission on Civil and Administrative Rules. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Chedly L. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kentucky Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
