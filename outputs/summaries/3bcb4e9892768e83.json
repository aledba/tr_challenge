  "summary": "On March 23, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against a Pennsylvania-based driver who was suspended for driving after underage consumption of alcohol.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, alleges that, in August 2016, Tyler Gerard Simpson was convicted by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing (PennDOT) of violating Section 3802(a)(2) of the Vehicle Code, which prohibits an individual from operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, intoxicating liquor or other drugs.  According to the complaint, the Pennsylvania conviction was based on an out-of-state conviction, which required a BAC of 0.08 percent within two hours after the individual operated the vehicle.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the New Jersey conviction was unrelated to the Pennsylvania one.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Licensee consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his license suspension.  Additionally, the court granted Licensee's request for a temporary restraining order and a temporary driver's license, and ordered him to comply with the court's order.  On March 24, 2018, the United States District Court in Philadelphia entered an order against Licensee, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil penalty of $25,000.  Separately, the Court granted the request for an emergency court injunction against further violations of the charged federal laws, ordering Licensee to pay disgorgement of $20,000, and a $10,000 civil penalty.  Finally, on March 26, 2019, the Honorable Kathleen M. Wroblewski of the Philadelphia Regional Office issued an order suspending Licensee from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any motor vehicle for a period of one year.   The court also granted the motion for an officer-and-director bar and a penny stock bar. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office in this matter."
