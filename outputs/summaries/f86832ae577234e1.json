  "summary": "On June 28, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a temporary restraining order against Oston G. Osotonu, a Vallejo, California resident, who was convicted of second-degree burglary and sentenced to 26 years in state prison.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Sacramento on June 24, 2016, the court found that Osotonus violated the antifraud provisions of Section 459.5 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also ruled that, contrary to the court's opinion, Osotonuses' entry into an ATM was not a sufficient entry into a building to support a conviction for shoplifting.  In fact, as the complaint alleges, the ATM was targeted as part of a larger scheme to help a codefendant \"destroy the evidence in his criminal case by means of an explosion.\"  The complaint further alleges that, as alleged in the complaint, the defendant agreed to participate in the ATM crime with the intent \"to create a diversion and to get money.\"  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced that it has filed an emergency action to halt the asset freeze and freeze the assets of several of the defendants.  On June 26, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $1,000. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Rymas of the Los Angeles Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by C.J. Kerstetter and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
