  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of the Lincoln County Board of Supervisors and the City of Brookhaven, Mississippi, in a civil injunctive action brought by Wilcher, Jr. and his family.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Mississippi, Wilcher's claim that he negligently left an unfinished culvert installation overnight, without warning drivers they had removed but not yet replaced a bridge, was not subject to discretionary-function immunity. Rather, the complaint alleges that the County and City had failed in their duty to warn motorists the culvert was closed or under construction.  The complaint further alleges that Wilcher had not been made aware of the bridge's impending collapse when he drove his car into the hole.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Court agreed that the duty imposed by Section 63\u20133\u2013305 was discretionary, thus entitling Wilcher to a right to recover.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Wilcher.   The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint alleges that Brantley violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) thereunder of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The Complaint also alleges that, in violation of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1, that the Commission of Inspections and Examinations (\"Commission\") failed in its duty to detect and remediate any potential violations of the Commission's Rules of Practice, and that, as a result of its finding, the Commission has failed to grant Wilcher a reasonable basis to seek a permanent injunction against future violations of Rule 15a-1 and Rule 17a-2 thereunder.  Finally, the Complaint charges Wilcher with violating Section 13(b)(2)(A) and Rule 13a-3, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar against him.  For further information, see SEC Complaint Bulletin No. 13-20-17."
