  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment against Mississippi state officials for violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Mississippi officials violated the antifraud provisions of Section 201 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the federal government unlawfully entered into an exemption for certain state officials in violation of the federal law. The SEC alleges that the exemption is based on the principle that states can only enforce their own laws when they are required to do so by the federal court.  In its judgment, the court found that Mississippi violated the federal laws, and that the state violated its obligation to hold federally-granted land in a perpetual trust for the benefit of schoolchildren in the southern twenty-three counties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar.  On May 15, 2018, a federal district court in Mississippi issued a temporary restraining order and ordered Mississippi to comply with the court's order. The court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction and ordered the SEC to conduct an examination of the issues raised in the complaint.  To determine whether to proceed with a civil action, the SEC requested a court-ordered injunction, an injunction, and an order appointing a receiver to determine the amount of relief that will be granted to each of the defendants.  For further information, see SEC Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17.  A hearing on May 24, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  An SEC hearing on June 5, 2018 is scheduled for 8:30 a.m., and the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Mississippi Secretary of State's Office, the Department of Education, and the Mississippi Department of Health and Human Services. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
