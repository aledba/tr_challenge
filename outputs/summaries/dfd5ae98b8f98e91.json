  "summary": "On March 7, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against a Rock Falls, Illinois man who was convicted of retail theft.  According to the court's order, on July 23, 2014, Frederick L. Holt entered a Walmart without authority and with the intent to steal 11 T-shirts, three packages of socks, and a dress.  The court found that Holt violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and entered the store without authority or with the intention of committing a theft. The court also ruled that Holt was not liable for retail theft because he did not have the requisite authority to enter the store.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Holt. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, charges Holt with violating the antitrust provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-3 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\"). The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. The complaint also seeks a temporary restraining order, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against Holt from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, John R. Rymas, and Amy C. McKinley of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. McKinly. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 123318 (August 2014).  The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling them investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov website\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert to encourage investors to consider investing in an investment in a private company.  Investors can also check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0Securities and Rule\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov\u00a0to identify people selling investments in companies with significant risk of losing their investment."
