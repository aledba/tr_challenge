  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Janet Sonja Schonewolf, a repeat offender who was sentenced to 40 months of supervised release following her most recent arrest.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in New York, Schonewold opened the case by telling the SEC that she had been prescribed Percocet for pain stemming from back injuries sustained in a car accident, followed by a fentanyl patch.  The complaint alleges that, following her conviction and subsequent release from prison, she began using heroin to satisfy her addiction and attempted to obtain a long-term drug rehabilitation program.  In 2010, the District Court granted a downward variance from the Sentencing Reform Act of 1940 to a term of imprisonment imposed post-revocation.  As alleged in the complaint, the downward variance was based on a need for medical care and correctional treatment, not on a desire to \"improve\" her drug use.  After several years of progress on supervised release, however, the court ultimately ruled that the sentence did not violate the terms of her supervised release and instead imposed an upward variance.  Schonewood, who is currently serving a four-year prison sentence, has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the federal sentencing laws and orders her to pay a penalty equal to the amount of her sentence.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the Court granted the relief sought by the SEC in its judgment.  On August 15, 2017, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the United States District Court in Philadelphia granted the SEC\u0092s request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval.   The court also issued a temporary injunction and issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receiver of the receiver. \u00c2\u00a0On August 17, 2018, the U.N. Office of the Inspector General issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Fraud Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage people to check the background of anyone selling or offering them advice on how to spot signs of a drug problem.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint also alleges that the Court improperly imposed a mandatory minimum sentence of 40 months imprisonment, which was significantly higher than the mandatory minimum of 30 months previously imposed by the court, and that the court violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, and 14a-11 thereunder.  It also issued an Order requiring that the receiver be present at the sentencing hearing for any reason other than the defendant"
