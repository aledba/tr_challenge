  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a New Jersey-based insurance company that is involved in an insurance liquidation proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, alleges that, in 2001, the Board of Education (\"Board\") and its general contractor, D & D Associates, Inc. (\"D&D\"), failed to timely complete three school projects.  According to the complaint, D&D's failure to complete the school project delayed the Board's ability to obtain a judgment on the merits of its claims for liquidated damages.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the Board improperly relied on material facts that had been excluded by the court in New Jersey and in Illinois to determine whether the Board was entitled to liquidated or actual damages for delayed completion of the school.  As set forth in the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal on May 19, 2015, the court granted the Board a temporary restraining order and ordered it to file a response to the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, the board consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement of $14,022,883.34 plus interest of $1,471,017.96 plus a civil penalty of $2,647,115.37. The court also ordered the Board to comply with its requests for an evidentiary hearing, which it did not do.  On May 20, 2019, the Court granted the board's request for an emergency asset freeze and ordered a hearing in which it would consider whether to proceed with the liquidation of the bonds or to issue an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receivership of those bonds.   The Court also issued an order requiring the receiver to provide a copy of the judgment to the receiver, which is subject to court approval.  A hearing scheduled for June 21, 2019 is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5/209 (1st) (2nd) (3rd) (4th) and (5th) (8th) of July, 2014. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the New Jersey Office of Inspector General. The litigation will be led by John R. Kelly and Mr. Kelly. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U."
