  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered an order permanently enjoining a class of former professional football players from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, alleges that Judge Anita Brody issued a final judgment on December 8, 2017, that permanently enjoins the class from future violations of the anti-assignment provision in the settlement agreement and orders the District Court to determine whether the class has the right to receive funds after the player has agreed to the settlement. The court also issued an order temporarily freezing the class\u2019s assets and ordering the payment of civil penalties in the amount of $1.5 million.  According to the complaint, the court did not have the authority to permanently enjoin all of the class members from violating these provisions, but rather to impose a temporary restraining order and order requiring the class to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Thrivest and Atlas, alleging that they violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the defendants violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating those provisions, and from participating in any future class action or settlement proceeding. The settlements are subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 18-2582 (January 22, 2018).  The settlement is subject to Court approval.
