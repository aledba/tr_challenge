  "summary": "On August 22, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California entered a final judgment against Maged Saleh Shaibi, a former cashier who was denied Social Security benefits in 2011.  According to the court's order, Shaibi raised the issue of whether a vocational expert could perform certain jobs in significant numbers in the regional and national economies.  The court found that Shaibi was limited in his ability to perform the following tasks: sitting or standing for extended periods of time; walking long distances without the use of a cane; and carrying objects weighing ten pounds or more.  Shaibi also alleged that the vocational expert's job estimates were inaccurate, because the job numbers were allegedly contradicted by the job estimates in the Department of Labor's Office of Economic and Risk Analysis (OIEA) published by the OIEA.  In a parallel action, the United States Department of Justice today announced criminal charges against Shaibi.  On January 23, 2013, a federal district court in Los Angeles issued an order suspending Shaibi from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an expert in evaluating whether a claimant with a disability was capable of performing any work that existed in significant number in the national economy.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the court also suspended Shaibi's right to reapply as an independent, on a joint and several basis, for a five-year period ending June 30, 2020.   The SEC's order temporarily enjoins the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendant to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  It also orders the SEC to conduct an independent examination of the claims in the complaint, which is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by David Burch and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Insurance, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
