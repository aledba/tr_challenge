  "summary": "On April 19, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of the father and mother in a civil action brought by the District Attorney's Office against him for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, the father filed a motion to modify a judgment of the trial court that had ordered him to pay the mother $483 per month in child support.  The complaint alleges that the court erred in finding that the mother had failed to comply with certain provisions of the judgment and that the father was entitled to a portion of the amount owed to her in a later judgment.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court in New York today entered a judgment ordering the father to pay $7,103.47, a total of $8,965.47.  Without admitting or denying the father's allegations, the court agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the father from violating the above-mentioned provisions and orders the mother to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of the mother's disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, a civil monetary penalty, and an attorney fee.  On March 30, 2018, a federal district court in New Jersey issued a temporary restraining order against the father, barring him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the restraining order, and ordering him to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court.  A hearing scheduled for May 10, 2018 was conducted in the background with the assistance of trial counsel, and the case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Welshhans and supervised by Jennifer C. McKinley of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. McKinly. The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alabama Department of Insurance, the Department of Justice Criminal Division, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Alabama Office of the Attorney General."
