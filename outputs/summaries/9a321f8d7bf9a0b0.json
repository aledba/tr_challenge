  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho today entered a final judgment against a former City of Twin Falls Street Department employee who filed two worker's compensation complaints.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Idaho, alleges that Charles Leroy Hartgrave sustained injuries to his right knee while working as a municipal employee.  According to the complaint, Hartgrave was injured while performing a pavement survey with a couple of other men.  As alleged, the injuries aggravated preexisting degenerative joint disease in Hartgrave's right knee and required a total knee arthroplasty.  Hartgrave, as a result of the injuries, was unable to perform the right TKA and instead sought relief of permanent partial impairment, disability benefits, medical benefits, and attorney fees.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, from 2009 until the onset of right knee pain on November 8, 2013, Hartrave was engaged in any number of \"general daily living\" activities that could have triggered the pain.  He also allegedly suffered from \"bone on bone\" arthritis in the right knee, which caused him to have to take an aspirin once in a while.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission's order, Hartvee consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Salt Lake Regional Office, and is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Health and Human Services, with the assistance of the Office of Inspector General's Retail Strategy Task Force.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica."
