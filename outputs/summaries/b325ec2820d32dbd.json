  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Star Insurance Co., the employer's workers' compensation insurance carrier, ordering it to pay $320,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Francisco, alleges that Maria Rosa Tavares, the widow of Armando Tavares and three dependent children, suffered a heart attack on June 13, 2011 while using the restroom at work.  According to the complaint, Tavares complained about having chest pains about the time he engaged in the physical exertion of power washing his equipment, which caused him to experience severe chest pain.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, that Tavares had very severe coronary artery disease and his sudden death at work was the result of a cardiac event.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Maria Rosa and her children have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering Star to pay a $250,000 civil penalty in the amount of five years.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Tavares.  Separately, the Department of Health and Human Services today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing investigation into Tavares's death.  On November 25, 2013, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Star, charging it with violations of Section 5 of the Labor Code, and with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 1333, 1333 and Smith v. Workmen's Comp. Bd. (1916) and 17 Cal.2d 588, 34 Cal.4th (1946).  The complaint also charged Star with violating Sections 5(a), 1333(c), and 1333 of the workers' comp. bd. and seeking a permanent injunction against future violations.  Star agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and requires it to be entered into a permanent conduct-based injunction. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5709 (2014). \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Enforcement's Retail Strategy Task Force. The litigation will be led by Ms. Cayton and Ms."
