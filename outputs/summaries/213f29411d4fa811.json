  "summary": "On May 12, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee entered a final judgment against Martin Kent for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Nashville, Tennessee, Kent was the President of the United Company, a Virginia corporation that owns Hilton Head National Golf Course in Beaufort County, South Carolina.  The SEC alleges that Kent was a \"crooked owner who wanted a government handout,\u201d engaged in \"Crony Capitalism,\" and was a consultant to coal philanthropy.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Hennelly, as owner and chief of staff of the company, directed many of his internet posts to citizens and government officials in South Carolina and Tennessee.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants' actions were expressly aimed at the State of Tennessee, and the defendants did not engage in any activities in Tennessee or have contacts with the state of South Carolina that would qualify them as subject to the jurisdiction of the federal district court.  For example, the SEC alleges in its complaint that Kent, as a citizen and resident of Richmond, Virginia, directed most of his posts to South Carolina residents, including his wife and sister, who live in the state.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Kent has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078.71, prejudgment interest of $2,098.81, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Kent has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  On June 2, 2013, the court granted a motion to dismiss by the SEC seeking a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order appointing a receiver to oversee the rezoning of real property located in South Caroliniana.  A hearing on June 24, 2014, was scheduled for 5:30 p.m. Eastern time.   The court granted the SEC request for a preliminary injunction, ordered a hearing on the matter, and ordered Kent to respond to the court's order by providing a copy of the complaint to be filed with the SEC.
