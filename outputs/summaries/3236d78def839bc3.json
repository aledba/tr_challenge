  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the New York Attorney General's Office (\"AGO\") in its continuing investigation of alleged mail solicitations that defrauded New York consumers.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, filed on April 1, 2015, the AG's Office of Inspector General (OIG) and the Office of Compliance (OCC) previously issued an order finding that defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that defendants, when soliciting for magazine subscriptions and renewals, have failed to disclose the date that existing subscriptions end, as required by New York law.  As alleged in the complaint, defendants are also liable for disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and for civil penalties in the amount of $5,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Court of Appeals granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the defendants' revenue.  Without admitting or denying the SEC allegations, Sansone consented to the entry of a final order that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders disgorge their allegedly illusory profits with interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson, Ms. Pugsley, and Mr. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Jennifer A. Birkenheier. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the FBI, the U.N. Secret Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).
