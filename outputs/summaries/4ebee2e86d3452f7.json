  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment in favor of the Watsons' request for a preliminary injunction against foreclosure.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Mound Bayou, Mississippi, Wayne and James Watson, Jr., were among the first to apply for relief under the Pigford Consent Decree.  The complaint alleges that, from 1988 to 1995, the agency improperly applied pigford relief to over $260,000 of their farm property loans.  As alleged in the complaint, the Agency misapplied the pigford-qualifying payments to the loans, which were delinquent at the time.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of $22,990.77 plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $20,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2019. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
