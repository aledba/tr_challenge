  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the college's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, on February 10, 2018, The Blake School, a private pre-kindergarten through 12th grade school in Hopkins, Maryland, suspended a junior college student for his alleged misconduct at a school dance.  According to the complaint, Doe was told that he would be unable to attend college without a scholarship because he was \"jostling people more than necessary.\"  The complaint further alleges that Blake's disciplinary process was unfair and reckless, and that he was improperly discouraged from responding to the claims of sexual misconduct.

Additionally, the judgment orders Blake to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  On May 24, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Blake, alleging that Blake violated its duty of care by failing to properly conduct its student disciplinary process.    In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Education today announced that it has issued an order suspending the student from appearing or practicing before the Commission on Education and the Status of Women, and ordering the suspension of the student who brought the allegations against him. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Robert Bennett and supervised by Anne St. Thomas, with assistance from Joseph Ruggiero, and the case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, under the supervision of Assistant Director of the Division of Education.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of"
