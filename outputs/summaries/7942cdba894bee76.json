  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Texas today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing litigation action by Texas-based design professionals accused of failing to timely file certificates of merit with the court.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, filed a civil injunctive action on July 31, 2017, alleging that TSU violated the antifraud provisions of Section 150.002(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 150.003(b) thereunder.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of the litigation action, TSU was unable to timely respond to the court's order to halt the litigation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins TSU from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against TSU.  TSU also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount that it will pay in civil penalties.  On August 24, 2018, the trial court granted TSU's motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered it to file an amended complaint with the SEC.  It also ordered TSU to provide a copy of the amended complaint to a third defendant, Satterfield & Pontikes Construction, Inc. (collectively, \"S&P Construction\").  The SEC's order, which was entered by the court on February 5, 2019, requires that all defendants file a certificate of merit within 30 days of the date the complaint was filed.  For example, the SEC previously issued an order freezing the assets of all defendants and ordering them to pay disgorgement of $31,000 plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a $10,000 civil penalty for each of the defendants.  Additionally, the Court previously granted the SEC\u2019s request for an asset freeze and an expedited hearing on August 26, 2019.  To learn more about asset freeze relief, see Litigation Release No. 15-cv-01221 (Houston, July 24, 2017).  In related litigation action filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of New York, the Commission on Civil Procedure and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the Office of Inspector General of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office have issued related orders to expedite the filing of civil injunctions and other administrative proceedings.  Among other things, the complaint charges TSU with violating Section 150"
