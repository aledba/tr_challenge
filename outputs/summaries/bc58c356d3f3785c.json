  "summary": "On May 22, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against Sparta Consulting, Inc. (\"Sparta\"), a California-based company that designs and builds custom business management software systems for companies.  According to the court's order, Sparta agreed to settle the SEC's charges by agreeing to pay $4.69 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount paid to Sparta.  The court also found that Sparta had failed to show sufficient evidence to show that it had breached the agreed-upon limitation of liability provisions of the federal securities laws.  In its judgment, the court held that defendants had violated the \"duty of proof\" provision of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Copart consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders him to pay a $5,000,000 civil penalty.  Sparta also agreed to be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On May 24, 2020, the Court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receiver of the receiver's receiver.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, charges Sparta with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and Section 13(b)(5) of Securities Exchange Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 12b2-2 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations.  It also seeks a judgment ordering Sparta to pay disgorgment of $11,364,460, or $16,244,461, in prejudgment interests, against Copart for a civil monetary penalty of $6,332,350, or a $4,500,000 penalty for a total of $20.37 million.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 516 (April 26, 2011).  The complaint also names as a relief defendant the liability provision of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (c) the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\") as well as the duty of proof of liability provision under Section 15(a)(2) of Exchange Act Section 10, Exchange Act Rules 10b2(b), and Rule 15a-14 thereunder; and the duty and determination of liability under Exchange Act Sections 17("
