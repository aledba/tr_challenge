  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the village of University Park, Illinois, in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, in 2013, the village appointed a new chief of staff, Eddie Ray Bradley, to replace Bradley. The complaint alleges that Bradley refused to participate in the pre-deprivation process, which is required by federal law, because he was not entitled to the requisite due process protections under \u00a7 1983.  According to the complaint, Bradley also failed to show that he had a legitimate claim of entitlement to a post-depvation hearing, and that he was entitled to a pre-disposition hearing.  In a parallel action, on May 15, 2015, a federal district court in New York City ruled against Bradley, finding that the village violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1983 of the federal securities laws. The court also found that Bradley had a right to a hearing, but that he did not have the requisite pre-emption hearing to determine whether he was liable under the federal law.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Bradley consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations, and orders him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the Chicago Regional Office issued an order suspending Bradley from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney. The order also prohibits Bradley from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any municipal property, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public agency. The district court's order also orders the village to provide a hearing for Bradley in the event of a delay in the appointment of a successor to the current chief.  It also orders Bradley to provide an opportunity to respond to the court by providing a copy of the Commission's order, which was issued on May 16, 2018.  To learn more about municipal due process violations, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 13, or No. 17-cv-01 (1962).  The court granted the village\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and other emergency relief.  For further information, see Civil Action No. 1292 (1952).  In addition, the court granted a request for an injunction against future violations of federal law and ordered the village and municipal authorities to"
