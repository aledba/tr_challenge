  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the City of Santa Rosa for failing to properly prepare an environmental impact statement for the Dream Center project.  The court entered the final judgment on consent against the city, which issued a temporary restraining order and ordered the construction of an emergency shelter.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Santa Rosa, California on January 8, 2015, Svinth and his firm, Illingworth & Rodkin, Inc., raised the specter of a potential adverse impact on the environment by using a series of statistical methods to determine whether a significant amount of noise would be caused by the Dream center's construction. The complaint alleges that, in reality, the project would not have a significant impact because it would be located in a residential neighborhood and would not require preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that the City did not consider the potential impact of the project to be significant under the \"fair argument\" standard, which requires a reasonable determination of the impact of a significant number of factors, including the number of cars and trucks driving through the parking lot, the amount of foot traffic on the site, and the amount and type of fuel trucks that would drive through the lot.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, S.V.P.'s Office of Environmental Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0instant.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Final Judgment also ordered the city to comply with the court's order.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the San Francisco Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Market Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Transportation, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Santa Rosa Police Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the U.K. Secret Service and the FBI's Cyber Unit in this matter, as well as the California Office of Inspector General's Office."
