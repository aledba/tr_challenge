  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against San Diego resident Suzanne Coe in a civil injunctive action brought by the San Diego Police Department against her for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Diego, charges Coe with violations of the six-foot, no-touch, and no-fondling rules and seeks a permanent injunction, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Coe has agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations and to the appointment of a hearing officer to determine the appropriate amount of monetary penalties to be imposed upon her.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Coe.  According to the complaint, Coe was aware of the violations but did not take any actions to prevent them from occurring. The complaint also alleges that the City of San Diego issued a 15-day suspension to Coe for her role in a scheme to revoke her nude entertainment business permit. The city's decision to revoke Coe's permit was based on a pattern of repeated violations, which the complaint alleges were not supported by the evidence presented to the court by the complaint. Coe also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about how to spot and prevent violations, see http://www.securities.gov/nude-entertainment-business.html. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Justice in this matter."
