  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against International Paper Company (IPC) and Paul Varadi, the manager of the department that sponsored the ISO certifications for the Eastover Mill Paper Co., for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that, from at least 2007 through 2015, Evans was subjected to a hostile work environment.  According to the complaint, Evans received a \"meets\" rating of \"exceeds\" from her supervisor, Gary Nyman, and received two prestigious awards during her time at IPC.  However, the complaint alleges that Evans did not show sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of an adverse action for her retaliation claim.  Evans also alleges that Varadi and other IPC employees made racially insensitive and offensive comments to her while she was performing her duties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina today announced criminal charges against Evans.  On March 10, 2015, the court granted the SEC's request for summary judgment against IPC, finding that Evans violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and ordering her to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Evans consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders her to disgorge her ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and requires her to submit a civil injunctive action against the company.  To settle the case, Evans agreed to a permanent injunction, to be followed by an officer-and-director bar, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Additionally, the settlement requires Evans to show that she has met her burden of establishing a reasonable person in her position to respond to a complaint of a similar nature.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 542 (4th Cir. 1999).  The complaint also seeks a preliminary injunction, disgorgement plus prejudgment interests, and civil penalties against all of her alleged violations.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Atlanta Regional Office, and the case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis and the litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Department of Justice, and"
