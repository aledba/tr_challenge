  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the parties' motion for summary disposition of their claims against each other.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on May 26, 2017 in federal court in Detroit, Michigan, defendant Milton Lebenbom violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that from July 5, 2016 until September 29, 2016, defendant allegedly removed $156,130.22 from plaintiff's account without her knowledge or consent.  The complaint further alleges that defendant did not provide any information with respect to when the hold on the account would be released.  As alleged in the complaint, defendants' claims were not substantively reasonable because the arbitration clause was ambiguous.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Michigan today announced criminal charges against Lebenbroom.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Lebenboom consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $157,192, a civil penalty of $1,038, and a $100,000 civil penalty for each of the defendants.  On May 24, 2017, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Bienenstock of the U.N. Division of Economic and Risk Analysis issued an order imposing a preliminary injunction and ordering the parties to comply with the court's order.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Chicago Regional Office by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Mr. Thompson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Secretary of State's Office, and the Michigan Attorney General's Office in this matter."
