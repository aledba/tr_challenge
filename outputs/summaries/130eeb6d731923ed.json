  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against a Kentucky-based mining company and its former owner for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Lexington, Kentucky, alleges that Kentucky passed a law in 1996 that imposes a higher impairment rating threshold on workers with hearing loss.  According to the complaint, the state's law required hearing loss claimants to meet certain impairment rating thresholds to qualify for PPD income benefits.  For example, the complaint alleges that, as a result of repeated exposure to hazardous workplace noise, hearing loss can result in permanent, impairment-ratable loss of hearing.  In contrast, the SEC's finding that KRS 342.7305(2) does not impose a reasonable impairment rating for hearing loss caused by work-related traumatic injuries, but instead imposes a \"permanent impairment rating\" that is substantially higher than the required impairment rating.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s case, the Kentucky Attorney General's Office today announced that it has filed a parallel action against Vision Mining, Inc., a Kentucky mining company, alleging that it violated the federal and state equal protection provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  On May 2, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Ky issued an order enjoining Vision Mining from violating the federal, state, and local securities laws, and ordering it to comply with the court's order.   The court also ordered Vision Mining to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, under the supervision of C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Fischer. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kentucky Department of Health and Human Services, including the Kentucky Office of Inspector General."
