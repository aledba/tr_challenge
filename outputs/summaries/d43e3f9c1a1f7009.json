  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against a Kansas City, Kansas woman for her role in an alleged child molestation case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that from at least 2004 through 2018, V.W. was placed in the care of a family member who was incarcerated for a prior felony.  According to the complaint, as a result of this conduct, Mother was unable to care for the children and did not have the capacity to supervise them.  In addition, the complaint alleges that when she met her son, Ja.W., who was also incarcerated, Mother told her that her son was a \"lying little bitch\" who \"used to push me down and do things that would hurt his bottom and his penis.\"  The complaint further alleges that she did not tell the children that she had a boyfriend who was in prison and that she was going to have to deal with the children.    In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Mother.  On May 23, 2019, the district court issued a temporary restraining order against Mother and ordered her to return to her job as a child protection specialist.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, Mother consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Kelly L. Gibson, Jennifer A. Birkenheier, and Patrick J. McCluskey of the Atlanta Regional Office, with assistance from John Rymas of the Office of Advocacy and Advocacy. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. McCloskey."
