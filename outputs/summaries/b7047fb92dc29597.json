  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment against a former primary care physician for his role in the collapse of a friend's leg during a soccer game.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Concrete, Washington, alleges that, on December 28, 2012, James Needham, a recovering alcoholic, collapsed at his friend\u2019s cabin. According to the complaint, Needham told the medical assistant that he was having difficulty breathing and that he needed a chest CT to determine whether he had pneumonia or a hernia. The complaint further alleges that Needham allegedly told the expert that he had difficulty breathing on the day of his collapse, and that Dr. Dreyer and the Clinic did not consider the evidence presented in the record to be relevant and reasonable because Needham had a history of heavy drinking.

On January 1, 2013, the court granted a request for an emergency court injunction against the Defendants from further violations of federal securities law, ordering the destruction of any evidence that the Defendants had obtained in connection with Needham's collapse. The Court also ordered the Defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $20,000 each, which is equal to the amount Needham has been ordered to pay, and requires the defendants to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.
