  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered final judgments against the Bank of Oklahoma, N.A., and the Vander Boeghs in a related administrative proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kentucky, alleges that the Bank violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to comply with its obligations as trustee of two trusts in Kentucky.  According to the complaint, the Bank failed to provide the beneficiaries with sufficient information to determine whether the trusts were entitled to a fair and equitable award of attorney fees.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, contrary to the representations made in the SEC's filings, the bank failed to adequately assess the value of the trust assets and liabilities and failed to inform the beneficiaries of the potential shortfall.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the securities laws, ordering them to pay $2,206,644 in attorney fees and an additional $407,915 in costs and expenses to the Bank, and ordering the payment of a civil penalty of $2.7 million.  On May 24, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws and orders the defendants to pay a $1.2 million civil penalty in the amount of $104,000. The court also granted the defendants a temporary restraining order, barring them from raising any additional claims of breach of fiduciary duties, and ordered them to file an amended complaint with the SEC alleging that the bank breached its fiduciaries duties by not acting on their requests for an attorney fee award.  A hearing on May 25, 2018 was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kentucky Attorney General's Office in this matter."
