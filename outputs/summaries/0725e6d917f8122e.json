  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the City of Gretna and its liability insurer, Atlantic Specialty Insurance Company, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Gretna, alleges that Ray Eskine was permanently disabled and required a walker to walk around the neighborhood. According to the complaint, Mr. Eskine began to traverse an elevated walkway over a drainage ditch in front of his house, when the front left wheel of his walker slipped or rolled off the left side of the walkway, causing him to fall into the ditch and suffer personal injuries. The complaint further alleges that Mr. Eskine was not aware of the condition and did not exercise reasonable care when he attempted to cross it. The SEC alleges that, contrary to the representations of the defendants, the Walkway was open and obvious, and the condition was not unreasonably dangerous.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On June 27, 2017, a federal district court in New York granted summary judgment against defendants, finding that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17(b)(5) of July 2018."
