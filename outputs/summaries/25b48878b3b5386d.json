  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a Missouri-based healthcare company and its co-defendant in a medical negligence case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on December 10, 2009, Dr. Barry Feinberg and his wife, Kimberly Dohack, performed an outpatient procedure on Claudia Ball, who suffered severe back pain. The complaint alleges that Dr. Feinberg provided expert testimony to the jury that the needle broke off from its hub and became lodged in Ball's back.  The complaint further alleges that the jury was unable to determine whether the needle was defective because the needle itself was not defective.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $507,000, prejudgment interest of $19,617, and a civil penalty of $1,019,617. The court also granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering the destruction of any evidence.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Missouri today announced criminal charges against the defendants. The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
