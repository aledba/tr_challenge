  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Antonio Cuza, Jr., who was convicted of aggravated battery, in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, on March 15, 2015, defendant Abraham Ezekiel Montenegro-Sanchez allowed an upstairs neighbor access to his apartment and yard for a child's birthday party. As alleged in the complaint, during the party, defendant pulled Elba Monroy Mojica's hair and hit her with his fist, resulting in a cut to defendant's hand. The complaint further alleges that when the two men confronted the defendant, he allegedly told them that he was going to let him go and that he would see them soon. According to the SEC, however, as soon as they confronted him, Mr. Montenegro and his roommate, Joseluis Castellon, went over and grabbed defendant, who was holding two knives. The SEC alleges that the defendant replied, \"No,\" and then continued to struggle over the knife, which he then used to stab the victim in the back.  As alleged, during cross-examination, the defendant allegedly told the other men that he had just gotten into a fight with defendant and had thrown him on the floor.  He also allegedly told one of the guest at the party that defendant had just stabbed him from behind.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Montenegro.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Montenegro consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of ten years, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing is scheduled for October 17, 2017, for which the SEC appreciates the assistance of the New Orleans Police Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the New York State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
