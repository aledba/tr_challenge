  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former Social Security Administration employee who was found not disabled by the agency.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York on May 11, 2002, former employee Dorothy Dugan filed applications for disability insurance, supplemental security income, and carpal tunnel syndrome. The complaint alleges that Dugan was not disabled when she was evaluated by a state-agency consultant, who concluded that she had the residual functional capacity to perform a reduced range of light work. Dugan also alleged that, based on this finding, she should be limited to occasional handling and fingering, and that, in light of her previous work as an electronics assembler, she could perform a significant number of jobs in the national economy.  The complaint further alleges that, contrary to the representations in the complaint, Dugan had no independent signs of functional impairment and did not have a history of malingering and exaggerating her complaints without any explanation or basis.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Dugan.  Dugan has consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and was supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Office of Inspector General, and the Office of the Chief of the Department of Health and Human Services."
