  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the Independent System Operator for New England (ISO-NE) against the imposition of new tariff rules.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, in violation of Section 206(a) of the federal securities laws, ISO-NE issued an order requiring it to submit bids in advance of the Forward Capacity Market Settlement in which energy suppliers contract to provide capacity three years in advance as part of a forward capacity market settlement.  According to the complaint, the new rules require the market monitor to determine whether a bid is just and reasonable, whether it is reasonable, and whether the bid is unjust or unreasonable.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Exelon has agreed to the entry of a final order that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 205(b) of that federal securities law, and orders it to pay a penalty equal to the amount of its revenue.  In addition, the final order requires that all bids in the forward capacity auction be evaluated under the same general Internal Market Monitor review process that previously applied to Static De-List Bids.  On May 12, 2016, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court in Manhattan, alleging that, under the proposed rules, a supplier may prematurely withdraw its bid in an auction, thereby dampening supply, driving up prices, and enjoying higher returns from other plants.  As a result, the complaint alleges that the new Tariff rules are inconsistent with what the Commission's order requires of a supplier.  For example, as set forth in the order, if a supplier prematurely withdraws its bid, it is entitled to assessment by FERC under the \"just and reasonable\" standard and to receive the equivalent of \u00a7205 treatment in case of a mitigated bid.  Further, the Commission has not agreed to a permanent injunction, to be replaced by a temporary restraining order, or to a conduct-based injunction, and to pay an officer and director bar in the form of a \"permanent injunction.\"  In a parallel action, the U.N. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that it has obtained an order suspending trading in the CFTC's securities, and ordering it to conduct an internal market-monitor review of all bids submitted to CFTC in the past three years.  CFTC has also suspended trading in its securities in the event of a CFTC finding that a supplier's bid is not adequately supported. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
