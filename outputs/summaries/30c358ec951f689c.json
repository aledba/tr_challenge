  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Bradley M. Schlott, a convicted felon who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for his role in a March 2009 attempted first-degree murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Will County, New York, alleges that Schlott violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he aided and abetted Hurschik's and Trejo's attempts to commit the felony.  According to the complaint, Schlott told his employer that he was not sorry for what he had done, and he was going to cut her head off.  He also allegedly told his wife that she \"needed to see to it that the boys get some of the assets.\"  The complaint further alleges that defendant was in no hurry to get back together with his ex-boyfriend and threatened to cut his wife's head off with a hunting knife.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Schlott.  On March 12, 2009, the court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered the unsealing of a criminal complaint filed by the SEC on March 13, 2009 and unsealed on March 16, 2009. The court granted the emergency restraining order, ordered Schlott to surrender his passport, and ordered that he pay a civil penalty of $2,500. The judge also ordered that the amount of the civil penalty be determined by the court at a later date.  After the court's order was entered, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in New York City, charging Schlott with violations of Section 15(a)(1) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"). The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Separately, the United States Attorney's office for the Northern District of California today announced parallel criminal charges.  A hearing for the SEC is scheduled for May 24, 2018. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the FBI's New York Field Office, and the United Kingdom Secret Service in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2008."
