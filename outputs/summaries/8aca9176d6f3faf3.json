  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against a defendant who has agreed to settle charges that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that the trial court improperly limited the defendant's voir dire of potential jurors.  According to the complaint, the court improperly allowed the defendant to use the previously-allotted fifty-five minutes to question potential jurors in open court in the presence of all parties.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, when the defendant offered the third text as hearsay, the judge immediately denied it.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the jury deliberated for over an hour before finding the defendant liable for the alleged violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the defendant consented to the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) and (d) of The Securities Act, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as a juror.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
