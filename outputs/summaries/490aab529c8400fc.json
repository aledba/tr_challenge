  "summary": "On May 23, 2011, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Hawker Beechcraft Corporation, a manufacturer of general aviation aircraft and component parts, for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Tulsa, Oklahoma, alleges that on October 17, 2007, a Beech Model A\u201336 Bonanza aircraft crashed in Tulsa County, Oklahoma.  According to the complaint, the airplane's engine had a fuel strainer problem that caused it to fail.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the engine was defective and caused engine failure, and Hawker intentionally failed to inform the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) about the problem.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in November 1993, Hawker's engineering personnel wrote a cost calculation memo which concluded no more than 50% of the aircrafts would be retrofitted with new fuel strainers.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission's Judgment, Lunn consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restarts the 18-year statute of repose, which provides for the right to reapply after five years.   The Commission's order, which is subject to court approval, prohibits Lunn from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any product that is not subject to GARA, including, without limitation, the provision of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 15b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,038,768, which will be determined by the court upon motion by the Commission. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's investigation was conducted by Andrew Depani\u2013Sparkes and was supervised by Jennifer Chun Barry of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Depani and Ms. Sparkes."
