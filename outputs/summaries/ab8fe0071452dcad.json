  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment in favor of the Virginia Department of Human Resources' (DHRM) motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Richmond, Virginia, alleges that, on July 24, 2017, Special Agent Kevin T. Taylor was terminated from his position as a Regional Special Agent in Charge for conducting warrantless searches and seizures at the Stephens City Moose Lodge in Alexandria, Virginia.  According to the complaint, Taylor failed to comply with the DHRM\u2019s order to search the premises and seized approximately $1,636 of gambling proceeds.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, however, Taylor was not required to obtain a search warrant before he could conduct a search.  Instead, the complaint alleges that Taylor sought to present newly discovered evidence in the form of witness testimony from Special Agent Bilwin, who declined to testify during the hearing.  In a parallel action, on March 12, 2018, the Virginia Court of Appeals issued an order permanently enjoining Taylor from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $2,078, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Taylor consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to return the gambling proceeds to his family, and imposes a $75,000 civil penalty against him.  On March 13, 2019, the SEC filed an emergency action against Taylor, charging him with violating Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933, and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against him from participating in the issuance of any search warrant.   In its order, the court also ordered Taylor to pay a $50,000 penalty and ordered him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  To settle the SEC case, Taylor also agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(2)(A) of Virginia's securities laws and to be restrained from violating Section 5(b).  In addition, Taylor agreed to a hearing officer's recommendation that the court order him to disgorge his gambling proceeds and pay a civil monetary penalty, which is subject to court approval.
