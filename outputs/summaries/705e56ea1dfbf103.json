  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Todd Bailey and Premier Biotech Labs, LLC, alleging that Bailey violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on February 27, 2017 in federal court in New York City, Bailey used confidential information obtained through his employment with AMBC to obtain a contract with the Michigan Department of Corrections (DMD) for drug testing equipment.  The complaint alleges that Bailey used this confidential information to advance AMBC's and Premier's business interests in competing with the DMD, and to gain an advantage over competitors within the industry who did not have access to the same information.  Bailey also allegedly used the information to obtain an additional $75,000 in revenue.  In a parallel action, on March 16, 2017, the United States District Court in Manhattan entered a judgment against Bailey that permanently enjoins AMBC from violating the federal securities laws and orders Bailey to pay disgorgement of $150,000, prejudgment interest of $1.8 million, and a civil penalty of $100,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit, and the case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Timothy J. Welshhans and Glenn S. Gordon.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, the FBI, and other relevant authorities."
