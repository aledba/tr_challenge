  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the four individuals who have been denied naturalization by the Department of Homeland Security (D.C. Department of Justice) for their roles in the agency's denial of their applications for naturalization.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, the agency previously denied each of the defendants' requests for a hearing on the merits of their naturalization applications.  The complaint alleges that the agency had previously denied the applicants' requests to have their claims reviewed by a federal judge.  As alleged in the complaint, the court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1421(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1940 and Rule 1421 thereunder.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that, contrary to the stated intent of the federal government, the defendants were not entitled to a hearing to determine whether a hearing was appropriate for their claims.  For example, as alleged, the Court found no preclusion where the plaintiffs could ensure judicial review of their claims, even if they \"voluntarily surrender[ed] themselves for deportation\" on the basis that an agency decision denying them a naturalization application was, \"tantamount to a complete denial of judicial review for most undocumented aliens.\"  The court also found that, in the alternative, defendants could seek a court-ordered injunction against future violations of the anti-fraud provisions.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  Additionally, the Commission has issued an order suspending the issuance of an order appointing a receiver to oversee the collection and processing of all claims under the federal agency's purview.  On May 30, 2019, the Honorable Judge granted the Commission a temporary restraining order and ordered the Commission to conduct an internal review of its policies and procedures.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Jarkesy and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's Office of Inspector General has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone offering to invest in a foreign policy by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to identify whether they are registered professionals and\u00c2\u00a0check the background"
