  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Verizon Wireless, Inc., a Texas-based telecommunications company, in an action that was unsealed on December 2, 2018.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on or about October 4, 2017, the Desoto County Board of Supervisors denied Verizon's application for a conditional use permit to build a one hundred and ninety-foot (190-meter) wireless communications tower at a location known as the Proposed Sugarcoated Site.  According to the complaint, the Commission's finding that the proposed tower did not meet the requirements of the federal requirements for a \"No Build Zone\" in the area required for a cell phone tower, was based upon insufficient evidence to support its finding.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that the Commission failed to adequately consider the concerns raised by residents at the hearing.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commission, Verizon has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  On December 6, 2018, the court entered a temporary restraining order against Verizon from violating these provisions, ordering the Commission to conduct a public hearing on the merits of the matter, and ordering a hearing on January 22, 2018 to determine whether to issue an order imposing a permanent injunction against any future violations of these provisions.   The Commission's investigation was conducted by David M. Mascianica and Eric R. Werner of the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Ms. McGlynn and Mr. Werner. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Georgia, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Missouri Secretary of State's Office and the Missouri Department of Transportation."
