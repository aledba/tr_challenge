  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against Craft Beer Guild, LLC (Craft), a licensed wholesaler of craft beer, and Rebel Restaurants, Inc. (Rebel) for violating the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, Craft and Rebel violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that, in violation of these provisions, Craft, Rebel, and the Commission violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Rules 206(3), and that, contrary to the Commission's findings, Craft violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Commission agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Craft from violating these provisions and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $2,623,466.70 in the amount of $8,420, which is equal to the penalty imposed against Craft.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against Craft against Rebel, imposing a permanent injunction against Craft, and ordering the Commission to conduct a conduct-by-conduct investigation that will be conducted by the Office of Market Intelligence and the Division of Enforcement's Retail Strategy Task Force.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office, and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Market Intelligence Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Jennifer A. Pyszka.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office, the Department of Justice, the Federal Retail Federation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Massachusetts Office of Regulatory Affairs (OIEA) in this matter."
