  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the mother of three children, M.S., M.B., and P.O., that permanently terminated her parental rights.  According to the court's order, filed on November 3, 2018, the mother was terminated from her role as a mother of 3 children, all of whom were in the custody of the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS).  The court found that the mother had failed to adequately participate in services provided to the children, including providing food and shelter, and failed to provide reasonable expectations of significant improvement in the children's condition or conduct in the near future.  In addition, the court ruled that the termination was in the best interest of the children.  As alleged in the court order, L.N.S.'s father, who was also terminated from DCFS, failed to follow-up with a case worker who reviewed the case plan and found that he was in need of assistance in finding a suitable home for the three children. The court also found that, in a parallel action, the state terminated the parental rights of the mother.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges the mother with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering her to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty.  On November 4, 2018 the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order against the defendant, and ordered her to comply with the order.  A hearing on December 6, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. Eastern.   The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Health Division. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the New York Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry, Ms. Boudreaux, and Mr. Werner."
