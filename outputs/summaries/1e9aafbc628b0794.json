  "summary": "On February 13, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against Sierra Palms Homeowners Association, Inc., a homeowners association created for the purpose of managing a common interest development in Azusa, California.  According to the court's order, on May 5, 2015, the defendants filed an amended complaint alleging that they had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court found that the defendants had failed to timely comply with the requirements of the federal securities laws and that they lacked standing to bring a claim for property damage to common areas arising from the construction and maintenance of part of the Metro Gold Line transit route.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, charges the defendants with violating Section 5980 of the Exchange Act, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal anti-fraud provisions and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000, $50,000 and $75,000 respectively, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Welshhans and supervised by Eric R. Werner.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Office of Inspector General, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
