  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee today entered a final judgment against Steven J. Thomas and his brother, Jeffrey M. Thomas, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on August 10, 2010, Steven and Jeffrey Thomas and their spouses, Delmus L. and Emily Faye Thomas, filed an answer, counter-complaint, and third-party complaint in the United States District Court in Chattanooga, Tenn.  The SEC alleges that the defendants violated Section 28-2-110 of the Exchange Act by failing to pay taxes on the property.  As alleged in the complaint, Steven, Jeffrey, and Delmus Thomas did not pay taxes for more than twenty years, and neither Steven nor Jeffrey had any interest in the property at the time of the filing of the complaint.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Jeffrey and Steven Thomas never paid any state and county taxes, and that neither of them had ever owned any farm.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws and order them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Separately, the court granted the defendants a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits.  On October 18, 2014, the trial court entered an order granting the defendants full ownership of the property, with the relief to be determined by the court at a later date.  A hearing scheduled for November 21, 2016, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern time.  To learn more about this matter, see Investor.gov/Investor.gov.
