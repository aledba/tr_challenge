  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon today entered a final judgment in favor of Georgia Expo, Inc., a competitor in the \"drape and rod\" industry.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that Georgia Expo violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Georgia Expo used the VersaTop trademarks in advertising and brochures to promote its system of coupling structural components, for example, and to manufacture and sell a \"ball and crown\" coupler. The complaint further alleges that the defendants violated the registration provision of Section 9,211,027 of the Lanham Act of 1940.  Georgia Expo has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the federal registration provision.  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against Georgia Expo.  On November 16, 2017, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order appointing a receiver to oversee Georgia Expo's trademark registration. The court also issued an order temporarily restraining Georgia Expo from violating the registration provisions of Sections 9, 211,027, and 9,212, and ordering Georgia Expo to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Georgia expo consented to a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating these provisions, ordering it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of its profits, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty. The SEC also issued a cease-and-desist order, ordering the company to pay a $75,000 penalty, and appointing an officer and director of a public company to oversee the company.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for today, and the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Georgia Office of Patent and Trademark Regulation.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-35406, November 24, 2017."
