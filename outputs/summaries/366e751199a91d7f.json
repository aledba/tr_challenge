  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against the agency that issued a temporary restraining order against a North Carolina driver for refusing to submit to a chemical analysis.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that Deputy Justin Griffin of the Union County Sheriff\u2019s Office prepared and executed an Affidavit and Revocation Report on behalf of the agency. The SEC alleges that, on July 7, 2017, Deputy Griffin requested that a driver submit to chemical analysis by way of a breath test. According to the complaint, the officer told the driver that he had to go with my discretion and did not offer a blood test. The complaint further alleges that the officer swore out the affidavit and attached to it an affidavit indicating that the driver willfully refused to submit. The court also found that Deputy Griffin was both the law enforcement officer and chemical analyst but he did not check the box for the type of test required by the SEC. The Court also ruled that the SEC has the authority to revoke a person's driving privileges for willful refusal.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for North Carolina announced criminal charges against the driver.  On November 9, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Griffin, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Griffin consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil penalty of $25,000. The order also ordered Griffin to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting to the SEC, Griffin has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to the issuance of a cease-and-desist order. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing is scheduled for May 20, 2018.  For further information, see SEC Litigation Release No. 17-20-16.2(a).  The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles, the State Department of Health, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Insurance Regulatory Surveillance Authority, the Virginia Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Office of Insurance Regulation."
