  "summary": "On November 19, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered final judgments against Walker Brothers, Inc. and its former director of human resources, Kevin Donoghue, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, on February 13, 2013, a former Walker Brothers employee was injured while parking in the parking lot of an employer's restaurant.  According to the complaint, the injured employee was not required to park in the lot and instead was managing his pain with medications.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the employee had a longstanding agreement with the owner of the building where he worked, where he provided a parking lot for employees, and where he had parked in the building during the past 12 years.  As alleged, however, the employer did not own the lot, and the employee did not receive any priority over Ace customers.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Walker Brothers agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $384.07 per week for 12-4/7 weeks, PPD benefits of $345.66 per week, and all reasonable and necessary medical expenses as described by Dr. Marra. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The complaint also seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Walker Brothers also agreed to pay an $80,000 civil penalty to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  Additionally, the settlement is pending final approval by a federal district court.  On December 31, 2015, the court issued an order requiring Walker Brothers to pay civil penalties of $160,000, ordering the company to pay $384,078 per week in civil penalties, and imposing a $1.5 million civil penalty against the company.  A hearing scheduled for January 24, 2019, was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (2014).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Chicago office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Chicago and the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
