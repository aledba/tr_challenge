  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against defendant Caleb Charleston, who was convicted of first degree murder (720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(1) for his participation in a drive-by shooting and sentenced to a 75-year term of imprisonment.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Chicago, on June 7, 2009, defendant drove by a location in Chicago as his passenger, Jeffrey Allen, fired 17 shots at Stribling. The complaint alleges that, at the time of his sentencing, defendant had been placed on probation for residential burglary as a juvenile and, upon attaining 18 years of age, stole a car and attempted to set it on fire.  The complaint further alleges that defendant had asked for mercy, but had not expressed remorse.  As alleged in the complaint, the trial court improperly considered as substantive evidence a defendant's lack of remorse and lack of concern for his family members and recognized the impact his incarceration had upon them.  In its final judgment, the court found that Charleston violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also ordered Charleston to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, which represents a 15-year reduction from the previous sentence imposed by the court.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Charleston consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $55,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $25,000 and $7,500, respectively.  Charleston also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay and Ms. Gaunt.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services."
