  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Montana today entered a final judgment in favor of the District Attorney's Office's motion for summary judgment against Marcy T. Kroschel, who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Kroscsel, ordering her to comply with the court's order.  According to the SEC's order, filed in federal court in Montana, on August 29, 2015, an officer stopped and questioned a woman and her friend at a University of Montana football game. The officer allegedly asked the woman for her full name and date of birth, which led the officer to conclude that she was not in possession of a criminal history and that she had committed no criminal activity. The court found that the officer had sufficient particularized suspicion of criminal activity to warrant a temporary investigative stop.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for Montana today announced criminal charges against the two women.  Among other things, the SEC charged the officer with misconduct in violation of the federal securities laws for conducting an unregistered search and seizure and for failing to provide reasonable corroborating information to the officer.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the officer has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(5) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.\u00c2\u00a0The court also ordered the officer and his friend to cooperate in the investigation of the alleged misconduct.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Scott A. Mascianica and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Montana State Corporation Commission, and the Montana Office of the Attorney General."
