  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Maryland today entered a final judgment against Anne Arundel County, Maryland, that permanently enjoins the county from violating the federal securities laws and orders the county to pay a civil penalty in the event of an emergency.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, alleges that the County Council passed Bill 85\u201313 in 2014, without requiring the County to bargain over the terms and conditions of employee health insurance benefits or plans offered to employees and retirees.  According to the complaint, the Commission's decision to impose a $75,000 civil penalty was based on a finding by the court that the Commission violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the Maryland Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action against the Commission, charging the County with violating the provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) the Securities Act of 1933.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the County has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating these provisions, ordering the Commission to pay civil penalties in the amount of $25,000, and ordering the County Attorney's Office to conduct an independent examination of the matter.  On June 24, 2016, the court granted the Commission a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against further violations of the federal laws, ordering it to provide an accounting of the County's financial condition and the costs associated with negotiating those contracts.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David M. Bunting and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Baltimore Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Burdick and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Maryland Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Maryland Office of Inspector General in this matter."
