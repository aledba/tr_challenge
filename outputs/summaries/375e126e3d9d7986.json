  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment in a civil action brought by the operators of a multi-party bankruptcy case against Michael Hurd and his business, Big Bear Caf\u00e9, LLC.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Montana, alleges that Davenport violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he was barred from bringing claims for damages in a prior bankruptcy proceeding.  According to the complaint, the court previously ruled that defendants could not bring claims in an adversary proceeding because they were not entitled to the same relief as those brought in the prior bankruptcy action.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Hurd.  On November 16, 2011, a federal district court in D.C. granted a temporary restraining order and ordered the receivership of the debtors' property.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay civil penalties of $150,000, and bars them from appearing or practicing before the court as a party in a contested matter. The judgment also prohibits the defendants from participating in the issuance or filing of a civil injunctive action against each of them, and requires the receiver of the receiver to determine the amount owed by the receiver.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release Release Request No. 671, 471, 176, and 24 L.Ed. 195 (D.C., 2010).  The complaint also seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.   The court's order also prohibits defendants from filing claims in a related proceeding, and prohibits the receiver from issuing a cease-and-desist letter or other emergency relief. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David A. Hoke and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the Montana Office of Financial Regulation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in this matter."
