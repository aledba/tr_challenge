The court granted the Association's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an emergency asset freeze.  According to the court's order, filed on May 17, 2018 in the United States District Court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Commission on Insurance Regulation (Commissioner) issued an order requiring the Association to submit a plan of operations to the Commissioner for approval within 60 days of the Commission's order's issuance.  Without admitting or denying the Commission\u2019s order, the Association consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins the Commission from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $200,000, and orders the Commission to retain meaningful control over the Association.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against the Association and its president.  On July 18, 2018 the Commission issued a final order imposing a temporary injunction, freezing the association's assets, and appointing a new executive director to oversee the Association&rsquo;s operations.    The Commission also issued a preliminary injunction on July 24, 2018. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Hannan and Carol S. Kerstetter in the Philadelphia Regional Office, with the assistance of the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations. The Commission's litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related case, the SEC filed an emergency action on July 6, 2018 against the Commission for violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and Rules 5a-5, 5c-8, and 17a-11 thereunder, and seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.
