  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky yesterday entered a final judgment against a Kentucky man who was convicted of second-degree manslaughter in a domestic violence case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kentucky, alleges that Lamont Brandon \"Teddy\" Appellant, a resident of Kentucky, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Appelant also was found liable for second- and third-degree felony violations of Section 206(1) of Exchange Act Rule 206(2) and Rules 206(3) and 206(4)-8 thereunder, and that he was liable for third- and fourth-degree felonies in violation of the Exchange Act.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges.  On November 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action and obtained a temporary restraining order, which prohibits defendants from making or selling any statements in the public record, and requires the trial court to determine whether a defendant is entitled to a fair and impartial jury.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal on November 1, 2018 and unsealed on November 3, 2019, Appellat consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s Complaint or otherwise denying the facts of the case, Appelat agreed to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged provisions, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing a $10,000 civil penalty.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver, and to pay disgorgement of $2,500, which is equal to the amount of his or her compensation.  Finally, the court granted the SEC request for a preliminary injunction, which requires the receiver to show cause and effect before proceeding with the offering of any additional information, including the date and time of the alleged crime.   The court also granted the request for an officer-and-director bar, and the receiver was required to provide a copy of the complaint to the receiver.
