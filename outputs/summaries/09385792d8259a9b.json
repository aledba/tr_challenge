  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against ACE American Insurance Company, Inc., a Michigan-based insurance company, in a civil injunctive action.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Michigan, AMI purchased a commercial properties policy from ACE in 2009. The policy provided replacement cost coverage for a security interest in a Detroit, Michigan building and in the equipment and machinery stored there. AMI claims that the property was valued at $1,920,000 and the value of the equipment was $138,100. The complaint alleges that AMI misrepresented the property\u2019s value during the insurance application process, and that Carolanne was not acting as its agent when she communicated the property value to ACE.  The complaint further alleges that, when AMI applied for coverage in 2010, it had two appraisals from 2006 in its records showing much higher orderly liquidation ($462,800), forced liquidation (385,450), and fair market ($415,300) values for the building and equipment than AMI had submitted to ACE in 2010.  AMI also alleges that it commissioned yet another appraisal rather than settle its claim based on the original valuation.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against AMI for its violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott Frost and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Frost and Ms. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Department of Insurance, and the Michigan Office of Insurance Regulation in this matter."
