  "summary": "On March 14, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against a former Carpentersville Police Department officer who was charged with insider trading in the purchase and sale of a luxury sports car.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, on January 17, 2012, a car stopped in front of a McDonald's restaurant and the two officers posed as drug dealers, selling one kilogram of cocaine for $29,000 in cash to a third officer.  According to the complaint, the officers entered the restaurant and confronted the driver of the Cadillac, telling him that he had the money and that he would use it to buy the car. The complaint alleges that the Cadillac backed up and hit the second officer, who was standing behind the Cadillac.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, the video did not show the defendant's hands on the steering wheel or the driver's side of the vehicle.  Instead, the complaint alleges, the Cadillac drove forward at a high rate of speed, and the officers' faces were obscured by ice and snow.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Michigan today announced criminal charges against the officer who traded in the stolen sports car for the $30,000 Chevrolet Silverado.  On March 19, 2017, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the officer to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the officer consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,038,767, and a civil penalty of $100,000. The officer also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a $75,000 officer-and-director bar. The order also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product or service, other than for the purpose of obtaining a copy of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (\"FBI\") Complaint against the officers for insider trading and for acting as an unregistered broker of securities in the sale and purchase of a sports car, which is illegal under the federal securities laws. The court granted the officer's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to be enjoined from future securities law violations. The jury deliberated for over an hour before finding"
