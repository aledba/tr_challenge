  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment in favor of the Van Rooyens' motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing their assets, and ordering them to pay civil penalties.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that, in 2016, Peter Weaver and Angela Reiter, both residents of the Republic of South Africa, approached Peter Weaver about purchasing rental property in Dallas. According to the complaint, Weaver and Reiter convinced Weaver to sign a property management agreement that included a three-year rental guarantee, completed construction within six months, and \"clear title\" to the property. The complaint alleges that this agreement violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the court should determine whether to impose a permanent injunction against violations of the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Texas today announced criminal charges against the defendants. The SEC also announced that it filed an emergency action against Greystone Home Builders, LLC, a Texas-based company, alleging that it had violated Exchange Act Rule 12(b)(2) and Rule 12b2-3 thereunder. The court's order freezes the assets of both defendants and orders the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2020, the U. S. District Judge for the Western District of Florida entered a temporary injunction against the VanRooyens from violating the federal anti-fraud provision of the Exchange Act, ordering the court to determine whether the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties will be determined by the court at a later date. In a related administrative proceeding, the court issued an order suspending the asset freeze pending final approval of the settlement. The order also temporarily halted the sale of any remaining real estate in the country, including the purchase or sale of a home in Texas.  A hearing scheduled for June 5, 2020 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 582 (Feb. 26, 2020).  The Court's order temporarily enjoins the defendants from violating Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(c) and 13(d) and 14(e) and requires them to show cause and effect to the court that they are entitled to the same remedies as the parties in the complaint.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations"
