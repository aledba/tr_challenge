  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against Willie Stroud, a convicted felon, and his brother, Bernard Degraffenreidt, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that, on 17 May 2016, Stroud and Stroud hosted two young women, Jermisha Baldwin (\u201cJermisha\u201d) and Kendretta Pierre, at their home in Chapel Hill, N.C. Stroud allegedly told the women that he had shot up Stroud\u2019s house and that he could have shot him.  According to the complaint, the women left the house shortly after Stroud informed them that he did not wish to file any criminal charges. The complaint alleges that Stroud confronted the women and told them he had \"shot up\" their house. The women left shortly after they confronted Stroud. The next morning, the two women returned to the house, telling Stroud that they had been wrestling with one of the women who had confronted them earlier that day. The two women allegedly told Stroud they were going to kill him because he was trying to take sexual advantage of one of them. The court ultimately found Stroud guilty of both the charges and ordered Stroud to be sentenced to consecutive active sentences of 99 to 131 months and 18 to 31 months, respectively, for his two convictions. The SEC also charged Stroud with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and impose civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of South Carolina today announced criminal charges against Stroud in connection with the same conduct alleged in the complaint.
