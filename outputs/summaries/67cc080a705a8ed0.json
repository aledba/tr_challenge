  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment against a Pennsylvania-based company that had filed for bankruptcy in 2015.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Somerset Regional Water Resources, LLC (the Debtor), a water-transportation business that serviced oil and gas wells in Pennsylvania, and its largest creditor, Somerset Trust Company (the Trust), fraudulently obtained a $1 million emergency loan.  According to the complaint, the Debtor was insolvent and was at great risk of defaulting on the loan. The complaint alleges that the Trust and Mr. Mostoller agreed to the loan without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In its judgment, the court found that, based on the material facts of the loan negotiations, the Trust was entitled to a refund of $1.12 million, which would be equal to any tax refund owed to the borrower in 2015, even if those losses produced further and larger refunds after being carried back to the 2013 and 2014 tax years. The court also ruled that, under Pennsylvania law, property owned as tenants by the entirety cannot be accessed by the creditors of only one spouse.  Without a new source of financing to keep the business afloat, the trust and the Trust could not have obtained the emergency loan without the repayment of its 2015 tax refund.  On the other hand, the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction under the federal tax law to determine the amount of a tax refund that a person owed to his or her spouse would receive based on how much of that refund he or she owed to that person.  As a result of the court's finding, the trustee was unable to obtain a refund. The bankruptcy court also ordered the Trust to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount owed to each of the parties in the loan agreement.   The court's order also imposed a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the Trust from issuing or selling any security, and requires the trustee to provide a copy of the final judgment to the trustee.
