  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was sentenced to 171 months in prison for two armed robberies of pharmacies in the Pittsburgh area.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Stephan Corrick, who was charged in 2016 with two felony counts of conspiracy, attempted to manipulate the sentencing guidelines to impose a downward variance on the amount of drugs that qualify as controlled substances.  According to the complaint, Corrick and his accomplice, Dana Shipley, stole approximately $2,200 in cash and $45,000 worth of various prescription drugs, including Oxycodone, Hydrocodone, and Heroin.  Corrick also allegedly told the court that he had a difficult childhood and that his parents were not fully present in his life.  He also claimed that the District Court did not meaningfully consider his objection to the drug conversion ratio and that it did not consider the mitigating factors.  In a parallel action, the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has obtained a court order halting Corrick from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering Corrick to pay a penalty in the range of 171 to 192 months, a penalty at the bottom of the Guidelines range.

Gershfeld of the New York District Court entered a judgment against Corrick that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar on Corrick.   The court has also agreed to an order suspending Corrick for five years and ordering him to surrender his passport and be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  A hearing scheduled for June 5, 2018 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court in Brooklyn, N.Y., charging Corrick with violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933, and Section 13(b)(2) and Rule 13a-14 thereunder.
