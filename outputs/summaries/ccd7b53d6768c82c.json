  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on February 23, 2012, entered a final judgment against a Berkeley-area landlord who defrauded the rent control board by issuing a 60-day eviction notice.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in West Hollywood, California, Jason and Karen Mak owned a residential rental property with four apartments in Berkeley.  The complaint alleges that in February 2012 they served on Elizabeth Burns, a tenant in one of those apartments for 28 years, a 60 day eviction notice, asserting that Jason Mak intended to occupy the unit at the commencement of a new tenancy.  As alleged in the complaint, Burns had voluntarily vacated the apartment at the end of June and was subsequently required to vacate the unit.  In response to the Maks' application to the Rent Board, Burns agreed to the termination of the notice and agreed to pay $2,395 per month in rent.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, Burns consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 1542 of the California Rent Control Board, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $1,074.68 per month.  Burns also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of at least 36 consecutive months.  On February 24, 2013, the court granted Burns' request for a writ of mandamus and ordered her to comply with the court order, ordering her to return the property to the owner at a reasonable rent level.   The court also granted Burns the right to apply for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any rental property, and to determine the appropriate amount of rent to be paid to the new tenant. \u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Jason Mak. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by the Office of Inspector General and the Market Abuse Unit's Analysis and Detection Center, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Office of Home Affairs, and the California Department of Housing and Urban Affairs."
