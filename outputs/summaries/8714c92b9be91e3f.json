  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Just Energy, Inc., a now-defunct energy supply company, for violating the anti-manipulation provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Just Energy violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Flood violated the broker-dealer exemption provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and (3) and of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Just Energy agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Flood.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Flood, who worked as a sales representative for Just Energy for more than three years, was the last person to sell a product to a customer, and he did not have the requisite background to qualify for the outside salesman exemption.  As a result, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  On August 4, 2018, the Honorable Judge William G. Donnelly of the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a temporary restraining order, ordering Just Energy to comply with the court order, and ordering the company to pay an $80,000 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000, which is equal to the amount Flood received as a result of his sales.  Donnelly also issued a partial order suspending the sale of the company's stock.   The court also issued an order suspending Just Energy from participating in any offering of any product or service that is not subject to the seller-supporter exemption."
