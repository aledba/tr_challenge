  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Wal-Mart employee for her role in a wrongful death and survival action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Lauren Murphy and Mark Collins violated the antifraud provisions of Section 15(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 15b-20 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Murphy and Collins met and agreed to split the cost of a DNA paternity test that ultimately proved Collins was the father of Tynslee's child. The complaint also alleges that Collins failed to provide reasonable support during Tyn's minority, during which time he did not provide for the needs of the decedent during his or her minority.  In its judgment, the court found that, based on the overwhelming evidence presented to the court, that Murphy failed to adequately support her child during her minority, and that she was entitled to a share of the wrongful death proceeds.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, Murphy consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $3,331.50. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Kathleen M. Burns of the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of Mississippi issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering the payment of civil penalties in the amount of $15,51-40. The order also requires Murphy to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and to pay civil penalties of $11,500. The court's order also prohibits Murphy from participating in any offering of pre-natal or post-natal care, and requires her to provide for any pre-term child's needs.  A hearing on May 24, 2019 will be held to determine whether to impose a permanent injunction against Murphy and her family members.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5-20 (Supp. 2017).  The Honorable Kelly L. Gibson of the United States District Court in Jackson also issued an Order suspending the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order against Murphy. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U-S Attorney's Department of New Jersey, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation."
