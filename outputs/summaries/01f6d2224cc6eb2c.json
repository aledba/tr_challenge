  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment in favor of Husband's motion for a temporary restraining order against him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in St. Charles, Missouri, alleges that Husband, in his role as President of PPI and SIA, improperly classified portions of the retained earnings of both companies as marital property and improperly awarded Wife half of the value of those shares.  According to the complaint, Husband was the sole owner of the companies, and he had the sole authority to distribute those retained earnings to the shareholders.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as a result of the classification of the company's retained earnings by the trial court, the company was entitled to a dividend of $400.00 per share for a total of 135 shares of non-voting common stock, which Husband received as a stock dividend in 2005.  Husband also received a cash equalization payment of $736,695 for each share of SIA stock he received during the pendency of the dissolution proceedings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the court has agreed to the entry of a permanent injunction against Husband and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $1,500.00, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the company.  On May 30, 2017, the Honorable Barbara Black of the United States District Court in the District of Columbia entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Husband from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interests, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar on Husband.   The court also granted Husband the right to a preliminary injunction and to appoint a receiver to determine whether the company is properly classified as a \"bulk\" or a \"dividend.\"  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, under the supervision of Amy S. Cotter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
