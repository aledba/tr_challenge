  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the father and mother of a California-based Indian citizen who were charged with child custody fraud.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in California, R.B. and D.R. B. Basinger were married in India and had a daughter. The complaint alleges that the father was involved with another woman, and the mother confronted him about it. The court ruled that India had exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) and that India was a more appropriate forum for the child to be placed in. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the mother and father.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the California Department of Children and Family Services, the FBI's Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Securities and Exchange Commission (FINRA) and the California Office of the Attorney General."
