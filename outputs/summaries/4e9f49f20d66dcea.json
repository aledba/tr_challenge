  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Houston, Texas man who allegedly violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, alleges that, on July 6, 2016, an officer conducted a Terry frisk on a car that was stopped at a stop sign. The officer removed a pill bottle from Young's pant pocket and then opened it. The complaint alleges that the officer did not have probable cause to believe that the pill bottle was contraband. Instead, the complaint alleges, the officer removed it from Young\u2019s pant pocket without reasonable cause. The SEC further alleges that Officer D. J. \"Jay\" Wiede, who was supervising the stop-and-frisk, observed Young making furtive movements toward the car's center console. According to the complaint, Young did not answer. The court also denied the officer's motion to suppress, and the jury found Young guilty of possession of a controlled substance and ordered Young to pay a penalty of 45 years in prison. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Young consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Texas today announced criminal charges against Young. The case is being handled by Jennifer C. Barry, John Rymas, and Amy C. Welshhans. The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry and Ms. Wyshans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, the Houston Police Department, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, the Department of Justice Criminal Division, the Criminal Division's Homicide Task Force, the State Attorney General's Office, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Texas Office of the Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit."
