  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio yesterday entered a final judgment against the City of Canton, Ohio, its officers, and its license technicians in an emergency action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan.  The SEC's complaint, filed on April 27, 2018, alleges that Canton and its officers violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 505.14 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 505.15 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to provide an adequate basis for enforcement of the anti-fraud provisions.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants did not provide a reasonable basis for enforcing the antifraud provision of the Ordinance.  For example, as alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Canton residents are not required to show that they are in violation of the securities laws when, in fact, they are not.

A hearing on June 5, 2019 will be held on the matter.   The Commission's order, which was entered by the court on April 5, 2017, requires that the court consider the merits of the proposed injunction and determine whether it is appropriate to issue a preliminary and permanent injunction against violations of those provisions. The court also ordered the Commission to consider whether to impose a civil injunctive relief order against any violator of the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth amendments of the Federal securities laws.  It also ordered that the Commission consider the options available to the violator, including: (i) imposing a $25,000 civil penalty; (ii) imposing an officer and director bar; (iii) issuing a cease and desist order; and (iv) requiring that any person with a prior felony conviction be"
