According to the SEC's complaint, on August 28, 2016, William Beal was driving a 2003 Chevrolet Silverado party bus with approximately 40 passengers when he lost control of the bus and almost hit three firemen. The complaint alleges that after the accident, defendant failed to slow the bus down and attempted to cut over in front of the firemen, who were standing next to the bus. The SEC alleges that the bus then clipped the right front of a fire truck that was blocking the right lane of the interstate.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Beal consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and imposing a five-year conduct-based injunction against him from participating in any future officer-director or director-level offering of a penny stock.  Beal also agreed to be restrained and restrained from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New Orleans today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action and obtained an order appointing a receiver to oversee the investigation of the matter.  Among other things, the SEC charged Beal for his role in the scheme.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Eric Burson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit and the Office of Inspector General, with the assistance of"
