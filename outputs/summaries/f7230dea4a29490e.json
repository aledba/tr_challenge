  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Plan B Club, LLC, a Los Angeles-based bar and restaurant, for failing to comply with a court order requiring it to compel arbitration of certain class members.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on April 24, 2015, Plan B and its general manager, Frank Grundel, made a strategic decision to delay filing arbitration until after the court had ruled in favor of arbitration against Sprunk. The complaint alleges that Plan B delayed filing arbitration because it believed that Sprunk had signed a class action waiver and that the court would determine whether to order arbitration upon her request. The court also ruled that the arbitration waiver was inconsistent with the right to arbitrate under the federal securities laws.  The SEC alleges that, contrary to the court\u2019s order, PlanB did not have sufficient evidence to convince the court that it had waived its right to compel class arbitration. The SEC also alleges that the defendants delayed filing class actions until after a court had issued its order certifying the class.  In a parallel action, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, the SEC today announced that it has obtained a temporary restraining order halting Plan B from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the above-mentioned provisions and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits. The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about class arbitration, see Litigation Release No. 13-20-2014.  For more information on class-action litigation, see litigation release No. 1203."
