  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arizona today entered a final judgment against Claudia Duff, a Pima County, Arizona resident, for her participation in a mandatory arbitration program.  According to the court's order, Duff filed a civil injunctive action on October 24, 2017, in which she alleged that the Arizona Department of Justice improperly imposed mandatory arbitration limits on defendants in violation of Section 12-133 of the federal securities laws.  The court also issued an order requiring defendants to submit to a trial de novo and subsequent appeal.  In a parallel action, the Arizona Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Duff for her role in the alleged scheme.  Duff's complaint, filed in federal district court in Arizona, alleges that the federal government violated the antifraud provisions of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying her allegations, Duff consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of these provisions, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $50,000, which is equal to the amount of her disgorgement plus interest, costs, and attorneys' fees.  On November 1, 2018, the court granted Duff's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits her from participating in mandatory arbitration, and granted her the right to reapply as a defendant in a case before the court for a hearing on the same matter.  To learn more about mandatory arbitration and how to apply for a court-ordered injunction, see Arizona Administrative Order No. 2017-116, (Sept. 30, 2008).  The SEC's complaint charges Duff with violating Section 1212-133, and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations, a conduct-based injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar.
