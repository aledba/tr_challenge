  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against a Salinas man accused of orchestrating a series of events that included the death of his ex-wife, Traci Derrington, and the destruction of their home.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salinas, California, Alexander W. Winn was charged with first-degree murder in February 2016 for the stabbing death of David Derrington. The complaint alleges that, in the days leading up to the stabbing, Winn told his trial counsel that he was going to meet with Derrington on one of his better days, and that he would \"meet David on a bad day.\" The complaint further alleges that the trial counsel failed to inquire into Winn's state of mind during the course of the trial, and failed to inform him that he had the right to rest without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. In addition, the SEC alleges that Winn's trial counsel, Terry Rockwood, failed to adequately inquire into the state of his relationship with the defendant. The SEC also alleges that Rockwood failed to provide sufficient assistance to convince Winn to consent to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 31 years to life, with six consecutive one-year terms for each of the enhancements. Winn also agreed to be permanently enjoined from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt of the Boston Regional Office, and is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by John R. Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of the United States Attorney's Assistant Director for the Southern District of New York."
