Ross, Jr., the former Secretary of Commerce of the United States, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, without a court order granting the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, Ross and his agency could not proceed with the 2020 census.

A federal court hearing on the same matter is scheduled for November 6, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1301 (Aug. 22, 2018).  In related matters, the Court issued an order suspending Ross from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.

This order prohibits Ross and the receiver from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the securities laws, and orders Ross to cooperate with the Commission on the subject of the Commission's investigation.
