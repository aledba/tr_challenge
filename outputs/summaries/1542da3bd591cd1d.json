  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Kansas today announced criminal charges against Alejandro Garcia-Garcia.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, alleges that, on May 9, 2015, Garcia-garcia, a resident of Oklahoma City, engaged in a high-speed car chase that began in Oklahoma City. According to the complaint, the chase began when a Kansas City officer pulled Garcia-gararcia over for speeding and told him to stop. The complaint alleges that Garcia-Gararcia did not stop at the stoplight, but instead ran towards the car and fired multiple times at the officer, causing the officer to fall to the ground. The SEC alleges that the officer fired a single shot into the car, which hit the officer's head. The court ruled Garcia-arrived at the end of the chase, and the officer was shot in the head. Garcia-Arguably the most likely outcome of the case would have been a different one.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment ordering the SEC to hold a preliminary injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the court to determine whether to impose a civil injunctive relief order.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the court has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the SEC from violating these provisions, and orders Garcia-Aguilar to pay a civil penalty of $2,850. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 10, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action against Garcia-Aggravated Therapeutics, Inc., a Kansas-based pharmaceutical company, charging him with securities fraud, with violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 15b2-3 thereunder. The case was supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Kansas Division of Criminal Investigation, and Assistant Director of the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
