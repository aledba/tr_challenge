  "summary": "On March 4, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, Inc. (\"GreenPoint\"), a New York-based securitization trust that originated 418 nonconforming mortgages.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, GreenPoint, which originated 418 mortgage loans, was obligated to cure or repurchase any of the loans by 60 days of either discovering or being notified of a breach of the representations and warranties that GreenPoint made regarding their quality and risk profile.  GreenPoint allegedly failed to cure the loans and instead repurchased the loans at a later date.  The SEC alleges that, as a result of the defendants' failure to cure and repurchase the nonforming mortgages, the defendants had no right to bring an action against them.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to timely notify GreenPoint of the breaches and, based upon its independent discovery or likely knowledge of the violations, failed to remediate the loans.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Trustee consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins GreenPoint from violating the provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of its disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Marcy S. Friedman and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Friedman. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Office of the United States Secretary of State."
