  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Aaron C. Rooney, Jr., a former account executive at a retail display company who was fired for poor performance.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Bentonville, Ark., Rooney was hired in March 2010 by Dean Metter, Rock-Tenn Services, Inc., as an account executive in a Benton County, Arkansas office. According to his complaint, Rooney was told by Metter that he was a \"great Jewish lady from Philadelphia\" who had experienced a \"Jewish resurgence\" and was building a \u201cJewish empire.\u201d But according to the complaint, after he was hired, Rooney did not communicate effectively with his new employer, and he was told that he had to \"fight the new office alignment\" because the issue required repricing.  The complaint further alleges that Metter told Rooney that he would \"have to start learning to take direction from a Jewish woman from Philadelphia.\"  In addition, the complaint alleges that Rooney was not required to recite an office roll call to rely on those shortcomings as a basis for his termination.  In a parallel action, the SEC today announced criminal charges against Rooney.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit, and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Enforcement's Cyber Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois, and FINRA in this matter."
