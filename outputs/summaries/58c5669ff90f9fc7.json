  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama today entered a final judgment in favor of Second Chance Auto Sales, Inc., a Montgomery, Alabama-based used car dealership, and its trustee in bankruptcy.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, alleges that Second Chance violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Second Chance's trustee, John Barbour, was appointed receiver of the Washington City, Virginia Midland and Great Southern Railroad Company by the SEC in the year 2000. The complaint alleges that Barbour was the statutory successor to a trustee and that he was not subject to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.  Second Chance also alleges that, in a recent case, a trustee who had been garnishing a debtor prior to a bankruptcy filing sought to have the trustee disburse her share of the amount owed to her in a civil action against Wells Fargo Bank, N.D.   The complaint further alleges that the trustee in Brickell did not invoke Barton, but instead sought to raise her shield by requesting that the court revoke the trustee's right to a jury trial and order her to pay a civil penalty of $8,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against Barbour.  On May 7, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Second Chance, charging the trustee with violating the asset freeze provisions of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the trustee has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the above-mentioned provisions, orders her to disgorge $10,000,000 in ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and requires her to provide a copy of the judgment to the court that issued the judgment against her.  Finally, the court granted the trustee a temporary restraining order and ordered the trustee to pay disgorgement of $9,736.04, which is equal to the amount of her civil penalty. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Burt of the Atlanta Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Alabama Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Alabama Attorney General's Office in this matter."
