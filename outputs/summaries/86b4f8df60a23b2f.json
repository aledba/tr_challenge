  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a temporary restraining order against a former college student accused of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on October 18, 2017, D.W. filed a petition and affidavit to obtain a sexual assault protection order against A.G., alleging that he made sexual advances toward her at a bar and that after leaving the bar, he went with her to her apartment and continued to make advances. The complaint further alleges that the trial court entered an ex parte harassment protection order on the basis of insufficient evidence, and that the court improperly acted as an advocate in entering the protection order.  According to the complaint, the court ultimately entered an order that permanently restrains the entry of the harassment order, and orders the defendant to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant has consented to a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an order requiring him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $10,000, and a $50,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against D. W. and a related defendant.  On June 11, 2018, the federal district court in Manhattan entered an injunction against further violations of the federal anti-harassment protection order, which was instituted on October 19, 2017. The court granted the SEC\u2019s request for an emergency asset freeze and ordered the defendants to return to their respective homes. The SEC also issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the court as part of a case-by-case review of the case.  A hearing scheduled for June 12, 2019, was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. EST. The hearing was delayed by an hour due to the fact that the defendant had been present at a hearing with counsel when he learned that a hearing had been scheduled for that same day. The judge entered the injunction on June 10, 2018. The next day, on June 13, 2019 and on June 16, 2020, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to entry of an order permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions. The defendants also agreed to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to a jury trial, and to the appointment of an officer and director of a public company. The settlements are subject to court approval."
