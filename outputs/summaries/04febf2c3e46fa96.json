  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment in favor of a Pennsylvania-based manufacturer of a gas transportation system.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Downingtown, Pennsylvania, alleges that, in 2007, the trial court improperly instructed a jury to determine whether a product was defective or unreasonably dangerous.  According to the complaint, the jury was instructed only on whether the product was safe for its intended use, not whether it was defective.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the jury found that the product did not have a \"defective design\" and that a manufacturer \"was not required to make it safe for use.\"  The complaint further alleges that a jury had been instructed only to find whether the steel tubing in the TracPipe system was defective when it left the control of the defendant.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 402 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay $1.03 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  On May 3, 2016, the Pennsylvania Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of the federal securities laws, ordering a new trial, and ordering the defendants to pay a $2.3 million civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.  This order also prohibits defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product, including the right to a jury trial.

In its order, the court issued an order requiring the jury to consider the safety of the product before it was sold to the public, including whether it is safe for the intended use."
