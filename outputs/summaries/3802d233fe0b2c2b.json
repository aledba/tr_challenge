  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was sentenced to 96 months imprisonment for his role in a drug-trafficking scheme.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that James Ryan, a technician employed by Securus Technologies who maintained the jail's phone system, and Detective Tim Hilton, a police officer who identified Johnson on the calls, improperly admitted that he had previously planned to take a gun to his grandmother's house and that his child's mother had likely informed the police that he was selling drugs at the hotel.  According to the complaint, Johnson also had enough heroin for 100 street-level sells, along with drug dealing paraphernalia and $5,000 cash.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Johnson made several phone calls to loved ones while awaiting trial, including one in which he claimed to have previously taken a gun and concealed it in a hotel room.  Johnson also allegedly told one of the officers that he carried a gun in furtherance of drug trafficking, telling the officer that the gun was mounted on a wall and \"unloaded antique[&&&#] mounted on the wall.\"  The complaint also alleges that Hilton and another officer falsely told the jury that Johnson carried the gun in order to protect himself, his family, and the revenue from the drug trade.  Finally, the SEC alleges that Detective Hilton, who also testified on the phone, had no reason to lie, to the jury.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Johnson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to a five-year officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David A. Schiff and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Police Department, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, the Department of Justice Criminal Division, the Criminal Division's Retail Strategy Task Force, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Office of the Inspector General and the Division of Enforcement's Asset Management Fraud Task Force."
