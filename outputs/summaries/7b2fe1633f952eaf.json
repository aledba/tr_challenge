  "summary": "The Alabama Department of Revenue today announced that it has obtained a final judgment against a defendant in a civil action brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Alabama.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Patrick Lee Downing was the sole member of Downing Enterprises, LLC, a business that sold, among other things, prepaid authorization numbers allowing access to wireless services on cellular telephones. According to the complaint, Downing failed to pay the entire amount of assessed taxes before filing a petition for a refund. The complaint further alleges that Downing did not have standing to appeal the Commission's denial of Downing's request to be refunded, and that Downing was not the proper party to file a final assessment or denied refund to the Commission.  Downing's complaint, filed in federal district court in Mobile, Ala., charges Downing with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. Downing has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay $18,617.86 in restitution, and requires him to reimburse the amount of his taxes paid. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a related administrative proceeding, the Alabama Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Downing. The SEC previously charged Downing with fraud in connection with the same conduct alleged in the complaint. In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia today entered a judgment in favor of Downing, ordering Downing to pay a civil monetary penalty of $20,000, and ordering the Commission to consider Downing's motion for an asset freeze. The Commission's order also prohibits Downing from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any municipal securities. The Court also ordered Downing to comply with a court order appointing a receiver to oversee the collection and processing of any delinquent municipal securities, including those issued pursuant to the Alabama Tax Tribunal's final judgment. The court also issued an order suspending Downing from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney.  On October 26, 2017, the SEC filed an emergency action against Downing, charging him with violations of the securities registration provisions of Sections 40-2B-1(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933, and the Alabama Secretary of State's Office charged Downing in a similar action. Downing agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commission"
