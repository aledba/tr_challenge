  "summary": "On August 9, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a final judgment against a Texas-based agency that terminated the parental rights of six children.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Antonio, Texas, alleges that, on August 10, 2015, the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services removed the children from their mother\u2019s home and placed them in the care of a relative.
