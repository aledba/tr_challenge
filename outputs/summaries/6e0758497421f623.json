  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Fort Worth Police Officers W.F. Snow and Javier A. Romero in a civil injunctive action brought by the estate of Jermaine Darden, a black man who was obese. The court found that Snow and Romero violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. According to the court's order, Darden was arrested on May 16, 2013, while executing a no-knock warrant at a private residence in Fort Worth, Texas. The Court found that the officers did not violate the federal securities laws and were entitled to qualified immunity for the purpose of recovering Darden's ill-gotten gains. Darden suffered a heart attack and died during the arrest.  The court also found that Officer Snow was liable for failing to adequately train the officers.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Darden.
