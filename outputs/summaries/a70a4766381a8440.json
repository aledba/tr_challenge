  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Charles Brown, an Ohio resident, for his role in a 2003 gun trafficking ring.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Buffalo, New York, Brown was hired by Beemiller, Inc., doing business as Hi-Point, to sell handguns to Ohio-based dealers, including James Nigel Bostic and his associates, including Kimberly Upshaw.  The complaint alleges that Brown, who held a federal firearms license in Ohio and sold the guns at retail as Great Lakes Products, engaged in a pattern of misappropriating and misusing the guns for his own personal use.  In one instance, Brown allegedly sold the gun to Bostic, who allegedly misidentified the gun as a rival gang member.  As alleged in the complaint, Brown also allegedly used Bostic's associates to obtain large numbers of guns for resale on the New York-based market.  Brown's complaint further alleges that, during several sales at Ohio gun shows in 2000, Brown sold numerous handguns, including the subject gun at issue, to defendants who he knew or should have known were prohibited from selling the guns on the criminal handgun market, including Bostic.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, Brown consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $15,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Bostic has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction, which is subject to court approval.  On August 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge William J. Hodgman of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio granted Brown's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered him to surrender his passport, and barred him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of five years.  He has also agreed to pay a $75,000 civil penalty and to be barred from the securities industry.  To settle the charges, Brown agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, sale, or promotion of any type of firearm, and to a five-year officer-and-director bar.  A final judgment ordering Brown to disgorge $15 million in ill-gotten gains plus interest and a $50,000 penalty is pending approval by the court."
