  "summary": "The U.S. Postal Regulatory Commission today announced that it has issued an order requiring the Postal Service to set a rate cap for certain mail preparation requirements.  According to the SEC's order, which was issued on Jan. 22, 2016, the agency is required to determine whether a mail preparation requirement is a significant change to the rates paid by mailers.  In its order, the SEC alleges that, in 2013 and 2014, the Commission issued a guidance to the agency on how to calculate the magnitude of a change in rates.  The Commission's guidance, however, provided that the agency could only consider a \"significant\" change in rate if it knew that the changes in rates would result in a significant increase in the volume of mail sent through the mail.  For example, the complaint alleges that the Commission could treat as a rate change every mail preparation change that results in significant changes to the rate of a mailer's volume.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's opinion, the United States Postal Service has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the price cap provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  On May 3, 2020, the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the issuance of an order suspending the suspension of the order and ordering the agency to conduct a conduct-based review of its policies and procedures.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Basinger in the Atlanta Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Postal Inspection Service, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Postal Inspectorate of Postal Inspections and Examinations. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether or not they are eligible for an investment in a specific mail preparation program.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against two mail preparers for their roles in a scheme to manipulate the price of mail in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties."
