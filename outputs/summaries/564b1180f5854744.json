  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment in favor of Via Christi Hospitals Wichita, Inc., an out-of-state corporation that provided extensive medical services to a severely burned worker and a workers compensation insurance carrier that paid the hospital considerably less than the billed amount for those services.  According to the court's order, in 2010, the Division of Workers Compensation (Division) created a \"stop-loss\" provision in its fee schedule to compensate hospitals for \"unusually costly services rendered during treatment to an injured worker.\" As alleged in the order, this provision was intentionally created to justify the hospital's lowered payment. The court also found that Paradigm failed to comply with the department's enforcement of the stop-loss provision, which, without the knowledge of the Division's manager of medical services or the appointed medical administrator, was unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious.  The court's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins Paradigm from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay $136,451.60 in purported full payment under the 2011 maximum fee schedule.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, Paradigm consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating these provisions. The judgment also prohibits it from appointing a hearing officer or director of a public agency to determine whether to issue an order imposing a civil injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Missouri today announced criminal charges against Paradigm. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Kansas City, Missouri, charges Paradigm with violations of the federal securities laws and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. Paradigm agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that imposes a civil monetary penalty of $1,048,569. The settlement is pending final approval by the court. The Court also granted the SEC's request for an emergency asset freeze and a temporary restraining order. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Kansas Division of Health and Human Services. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Kansas Department of Insurance, and the Missouri Department of Banking and Securities."
