  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas yesterday entered a final judgment against a Navasota Police Department peace officer who was charged with unlawfully acting as a peace officer in an attempted arrest outside his primary jurisdiction.  The court found that Rey Garza violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also found that Garza was not entitled to official immunity under the federal securities laws because he was not authorized to make a warrantless arrest.  According to the court's order, Garza's conduct was not within the scope of his duties and, in the alternative, he was acting as an officer under his commission.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Garza.  Garza has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal and state securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Miami Regional Office and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The case has been supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
