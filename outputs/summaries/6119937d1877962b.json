  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Carter, who was convicted on 14 counts of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Carter, ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  According to the court's order, Carter consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi.  In its order, the court found that Carter violated the right to a face-to-face confrontation provision of the federal securities laws, and that he violated the First Amendment by failing to comply with certain of those provisions.  As a result, Carter was ultimately sentenced to 40 years in prison.  On April 4, 2016, the Court granted the SEC\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction against Carter and ordered him to appear before the court in person on all fourteen counts of the criminal case.  To learn more about Face-To-Face Confrontation Clause violations, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (March 21, 2018).  The SEC also issued an order suspending Carter from appearing in public before the SEC as a witness in a case involving a child who had been victimized by an adult who was also a victim of the same conduct.   The Court also ordered Carter to cooperate with the SEC in its investigation of the matter.  It also ordered the SEC to provide a copy of the SEC complaint to the SEC, which is continuing its litigation against Carter.  For further information, see SEC v. Carter, No. 10-cr-17221 (Jan. 20, 2019).  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice Education today announced that it has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office in this matter, as well as the FBI's Office of Criminal Investigations."
