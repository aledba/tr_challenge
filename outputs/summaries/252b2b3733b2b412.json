  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas yesterday entered a final judgment against the defendant in a civil injunctive action brought by McKnight and Johnson.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Matthew Calvert, a resident of the United Kingdom, ran a stop sign in a residential neighborhood, injuring appellant Phillip McKnight. According to the complaint, Calvert claimed that he ran the stop sign because he couldn't see it because it was covered by trees. The complaint further alleges that McKnight's wife, Tami Johnson, testified that she was not at liberty to award damages for past disfigurement because she didn't have the evidence to prove that the city or the homeowners owed any duty with respect to the obscured stop sign. The SEC alleges that the jury found that Calvert and Johnson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the court improperly denied their motion for a directed verdict.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Calvert.  McKnight, Johnson, and the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA) issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint alleges that, in its complaint filed in federal district court in Houston, Texas, the defendant and the city of Houston failed to adequately disclose to investors that they had a duty to warn of, or to correct, the obscured condition of, the stopped sign.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes civil penalties of $60,000 and $25,000, respectively. The settlement is subject to court approval.  McAllister and Johnson agreed to settle the case by consenting to permanent injunctions and to the issuance of a civil penalty of $15,000.  Johnson and McKnight also agreed to be barred from serving as officers or directors of a public company and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged violations. The settlements are subject to approval by the court by the SEC.   The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. McCole, and supervised by Ms. Johnson."
