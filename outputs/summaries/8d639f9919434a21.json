  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a former DOE contractor who sought relief from the Department of Energy's (DOE) denial of his claims under the federal Occupational Illness Compensation Program.  According to the SEC's complaint, on January 1, 2015, Houston filed a claim under Part B of the EEOICPA for his illnesses, alleging that he developed sarcoidosis in his eye as a result of his employment at the DOE.  The complaint alleges that the DOE's denial of Houston's Part B claim was an arbitrary and capricious decision, and that the agency failed to consider whether Houston's exposure to toxic substances caused his illness.  As alleged in the complaint, Houston failed to present any evidence to support his claim, and the DOL ultimately declined to consider his Part E claim as well.  In a parallel action, on March 15, 2016, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Mascianica of the United States District Court in New York granted Houston's request for a temporary restraining order, freezing his assets, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Houston consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Houston to pay disgorgement of $30,000, plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a $10,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the DOE has agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a permanent injunction and to the appointment of a receiver to determine whether Houston qualifies as a relief claimant under the agency's policies and procedures.  Additionally, Houston has agreed that the District Attorney's Office will determine whether to issue a civil injunctive relief order against Houston.  On March 20, 2017, the court issued a final decision in which it agreed with the district attorney's recommendation that Houston be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and ordered Houston to submit a written response to the Commission's recommendation by the date on which the Commission issued its final decision.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General's (OIG) and the Division of Health and Human Services (DHS) Criminal Investigation. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's litigation will be led by Mr. Houston and Ms. Cianica."
