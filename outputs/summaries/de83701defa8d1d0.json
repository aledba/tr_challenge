Hess was also charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Hess agreed to settle the case by paying restitution in the amount of $8,116.35, which is the amount requested by the court. Hess also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years. The court also ordered Hess to pay $391.95 in restitution.  The court's order against Hess, which was entered yesterday, permanently enjoins Hess from violating the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a $1,100 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against Hess. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott A. McCole and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ada Police Department, and the Ada City Police Department in this matter.\u00c2\u00a0Investigating the issue of restitution is a matter for the court to determine, among other things, whether to impose a restitution order or to determine whether to suspend or revoke the restitution ordered by the district court."
