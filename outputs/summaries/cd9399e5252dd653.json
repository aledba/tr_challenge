  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against California-based nonprofit groups Communities for a Better Environment and Center for Biological Diversity (CBE) and San Diego-based Farm Sanctuary, Inc. (SFID) in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alameda County, California, alleges that, between 1974 and 1996, the California Department of Energy and the California State Controller (Controller) improperly limited the scope of judicial review for Energy Commission certifications.  According to the complaint, the Commission issued its certifications in 1974, and in 1996 and 1997, the Department of Commerce and the Controller issued them.  In its judgments, the court found that the Commission violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, orders the Commission to comply with the Commission and the Rules of Practice, including that it will continue with its review of the Commission certification decisions.   The Commission has also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which will be offset by a $50,000 civil penalty, and a $75,000 penalty for the District Attorney's Office of Sonoma County.  Additionally, the Court will determine whether to grant a preliminary injunction against further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The Court also ordered the Division of Enforcement to conduct an independent review of these matters.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17.  Separately, the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the Investor Alert feature to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and to quickly spot signs of unusual activity.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC's Complaint alleges that California Secretary of State Patrick McCluskey issued an order requiring the Commission, the Controller, and the Auditor General of California to conduct independent reviews of Power Plant Certification decisions before they were issued by the Commission.  This order requires the Commission"
