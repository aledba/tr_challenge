  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Yelp, Inc.'s (YELP) motion to compel the company to produce documents related to an ongoing civil injunctive action brought by a San Francisco-based pharmaceutical company.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that Yelp violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the court found that Yelp lacked standing to assert the First Amendment rights of its anonymous reviewer, Alex M. Montagna, because he prepared a tax return for his client without her knowledge or consent, and that Montagna had not caused her to hire another firm to redo his work.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Yelp has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $4,962.59, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that will be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Yelp for its role in this matter.  On January 31, 2017, the SEC issued its final judgment, ordering Yelp to comply with a subpoena requiring it to produce information about the identity of an individual who posted a negative review on its site. The SEC previously issued a subpoena for information about an individual in violation of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder, and a related subpoena issued by a federal district court for a third party. The court also issued a temporary restraining order halting the issuance of the subpoena and ordering a hearing to determine whether to proceed with the litigation.  Last week, the Court granted the SEC request for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a)(1) of The Securities Act of 1933, and Rule 15a-3 thereunder; ordered Yelp to provide a copy of the SEC subpoena to the SEC; and ordered it to provide an accounting of the amount and nature of the alleged harm caused to the individual in the complaint.  It also ordered the SEC to conduct an investigation into whether to issue an asset freeze, which it did, and to determine the appropriate conduct of the investigation.  To learn more about the SEC, see SEC Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 31, 2000)."
