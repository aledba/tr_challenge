  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was sentenced to 673 days in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, alleges that William Carl Welsh, who was previously incarcerated for a sexually dangerous person, failed to update his registration in his former homestate after moving to Belize.  According to the complaint, Welsh was in the agency's custody when he was certified as a \"sexually dangerous person\" and was transferred to the Butner Federal Correctional Institution in Charlotte, North Carolina.  As alleged, while in the federal prison, Welsh failed to comply with the federal civil commitment provisions of Section 4 of the Adam Walsh Act of 1940.  In its judgment, the court found that the federal government's authority to civilly commit a person to the institution of a sexual dangerous person was not jurisdictional, and that Welsh should remain civilly committed.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Welsh consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 60(b)(5) of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Welsh also agreed to be permanently barred from participating in a treatment program for sex offenders, and to be subject to significant reporting requirements if he is subsequently released from the institution.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release Release Order No. 4248(a).  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order appointing a receiver to monitor the progress of a sex offender's release from prison.  On May 2, 2018, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Oregon, charging Welsh with violating the anti-fraud provision of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting Welsh's violations of Rule 5(b) and (c) thereunder of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act Rule 206(3) and 206 (4th Cir. 2011).  The complaint also alleges that the agency failed to consider the importance of the custody provision to the agency that certifies a person as a sex dangerous person and ordered Welsh to be released pending a hearing to determine whether he was a sufficient person to do so.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that Welsh was not in the legal custody at the time the agency certified him as asex dangerous."
