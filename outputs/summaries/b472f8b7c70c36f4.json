  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alaska today entered a final judgment against a defendant who filed a motion under Alaska Civil Rule 60(b)(6) to reopen his post-conviction relief case on the ground that recent case law had shown the dismissal to be erroneous. The court found that Powell was entitled to relief under the federal securities laws because he had successfully appealed a judgment that was void. The Court also found that a defendant could not apply for relief under certain provisions of the securities laws, such as Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the court could not determine whether a defendant had properly appealed the dismissal of his prior case. Powell also alleged that his trial counsel had incompetently failed to timely inform him of a favorable plea offer extended by the court. Powell's second post conviction relief application was dismissed as untimely on the basis that he could not have raised the same arguments as Geisinger in his appeal because he did not preserve those arguments. The judgment was void and Powell was foreclosed from raising the same ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims in his second case. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Powell. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alaska, charges Powell with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The complaint also seeks a preliminary injunction, an officer-and-director bar, a penny stock bar, and an officer and director bar.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alaska Attorney General's Office, and the Alaska Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
