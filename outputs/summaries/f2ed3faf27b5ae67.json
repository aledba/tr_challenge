  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Wisconsin today entered a final judgment against a former probation officer for aiding and abetting a bank robber's brandishing of a gun during a bank robbery.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Plain, Wisconsin, alleges that, on February 7, 2017, Judge Michael E. Koller of the U.C. District court for the Southern District of New York entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Thomas from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of five years and a seven-year prison term.  According to the complaint, Thomas agreed to the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the court, and agreed to settle the matter by agreeing to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan today announced criminal charges against Thomas.  On February 8, 2018, Judge Koller issued a temporary restraining order against Thomas, ordering him to surrender his passport, and imposing a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from associating with anyone with a prior conviction for a felony.  Thomas also agreed to be barred from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney in the future.   The court also ordered Thomas to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $20,000 and $30,000, respectively.  To settle the case, the court agreed to a permanent injunction against Thomas and ordered him to comply with the court order, which requires him to show cause and effect, including a willingness to cooperate with the SEC in its investigation of the bank robbery, to provide an accounting of the losses incurred in the alleged bank robbery and to provide a background check on the bank's progress.  Without admitting the allegations in the SEC's case, Thomas consented to a court order that permanently restrains him from participating in any future conduct that may affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the case.  Judge Keller also agreed not to violate the Speedy Trial Clause of the Sixth Amendment.  He also agreed, without admitting the facts, to be permanently enjoined from future participation in any conduct that constitutes a reasonable person's right to a fair trial.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 562 F.3d (7th Cir. 2010).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
