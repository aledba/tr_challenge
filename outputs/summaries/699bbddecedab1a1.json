  "summary": "The Texas Department of Family and Protective Services today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting the termination of parental rights of three children.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Texas, alleges that, in 2001, the Texas Attorney General's Office obtained a court order freezing the assets of three of the children, T.L.E. and D.V.E., who had been living together for more than twenty years.  According to the complaint, the court found that Father violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also found that, contrary to the court's finding, Father violated Section 161.001(b)(1)(D) and (E) of Section 9 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 9b2-1 thereunder, and that he violated Section 15(a)(1) and Rule 15b2(a) thereunder of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Father has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion of the court.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Father.  On May 8, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Father, charging him with violating Section 15 of the Exchange Act and Rules 15b-20, 13a-1, and 13b-11 thereunder and with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0Securities Act and Rule\u00c2\u00a0206(4)-8 thereunder against Father and charged him with aiding and abetting Father\u2019s violations of Section 15a-3 and Section 15e-4 of the Commission on the Status of the Child. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction against Father from future violations of these provisions, as well as an order requiring him to register as a sex offender.
