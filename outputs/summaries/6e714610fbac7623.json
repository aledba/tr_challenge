  "summary": "On April 19, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Citizens Bank, N.A., a national bank that offers checking account services to its customers.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, in 2005, Citizens Bank charged an overdraft fee of $30 regardless of the amount of the customer's overdrawn account.  According to the complaint, this fee is not \"interest\" under the National Bank Act and is not a \"non-interest\" charge under the NBA.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the bank charged a flat excess overdraft charge when a customer overdraws her account and did not cover it.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the bank consented to the final judgment, which permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a $30,000 civil penalty.  On May 17, 2007, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Citizens, alleging that it violated Section 85 of the National Banking Act, and that it is entitled to a \"great weight\" in interpreting and administering the NBA, including the right to a preliminary injunction, a penny stock bar, and an officer-and-director bar.   The complaint also seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty against the bank.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5393636, July 2, 2007. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
