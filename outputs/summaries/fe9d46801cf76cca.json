  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendants for breach of fiduciary duty in failing to approve the sale of an apartment in Woodmere, New York.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that in 2000, Sylvia Berkowitz and her husband Martin Berkowitz purchased Unit 4J of defendant 29 Woodmere Owners, Inc., a residential cooperative corporation.  According to the complaint, the Berkowitzs sought to sell the apartment to a third purchaser based upon the low sale price offered by the Lax and Manginelli contracts.  As alleged, the Board of Directors then rejected the second prospective buyer for $160,000, which was $40,000 less than the supposed insufficient offer.  In a parallel action, the Honorable Denise Sher of the United States District Court in Manhattan today issued a temporary restraining order against Berkowitz, Berkowitz's son, and Steven Mirsky, an officer of the managing agent.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,038,767, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Separately, the court issued an order freezing the assets of the defendants, prohibiting them from acquiring or selling the apartment, and ordering the receivership of the remaining assets.  On September 30, 2014, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendants and sought a temporary injunction, an accounting, and an officer-and-director bar against them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, sale, or sale of any security, including the right to a jury trial.   The complaint also seeks a preliminary injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and the return of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest from the defendants.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (Aug. 2, 2013).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the New York Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0institutions."
