  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico today entered a final judgment against Maria Vasarelyi, daughter-in-law of deceased \"Op Art\" artist Victor Vasarelys, on several of her counterclaims against her business partner, Luis Rojas-Buscaglia (better known as \"Yvaral\"). The court found that Rojas violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Rojas to pay a civil penalty of $1,075,000. Rojas consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The final judgment, which was entered on October 19, 2016, permanently enjoins Rojas from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and orders him to pay $5,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The court's order also orders Rojas not to violate Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Miami Regional Office and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Gaunt.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Puerto Rico Office of Inspector General in this matter."
