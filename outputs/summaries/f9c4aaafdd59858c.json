  "summary": "On February 14, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the producers of Mob Wives, a reality television show.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Andrew M. Klapper, M.D., a plastic surgeon who is licensed to practice medicine in New York State, and his company, JustJenn Productions, agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and injunctive relief.  Klapper also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Klapper has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $2,500 in disgorgment and prejudgment interests, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Separately, the court granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, and ordered Klapper to return to New York.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Klapper.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Kasper and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Office of Inspector General, and the New Jersey Department of Health and Human Services. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0instant.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the Office of Professional and Risk Analysis has also issued an Investor Alert about potential lawsuits arising out of or related to the alleged misconduct of certain of Klapper's co-stars, including Debra D'Avanzo, Carla Facciolo, Karen Gravano, and Debbie Wasserman Schultz. The Office of Compliance has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint\u00c2\u00a0requiring\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0the SEC\u00c2\u00a0finds reasonable expectations and purposes of the ordinary business person when making an ordinary business contract\u00c2\u00a0with respect to any and all parties involved in the production or promotion of a television program."
