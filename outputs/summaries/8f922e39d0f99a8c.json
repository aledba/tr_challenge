  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, alleges that the Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Labor issued false and misleading statements to the public in connection with the issuance of the New IFRs.  According to the complaint, these false statements were designed to give the impression that the federal government had sufficient authority to impose a substantial burden on the health and well-being of its residents.

The Complaint also seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Finally, the Court granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval, to the appointment of a receiver to determine whether to issue an order imposing an injunction or requiring an officer-and-director bar against the defendants.  On June 26, 2017, the Honorable Judge Steven T. Cohen of the U.C. Division of Justice issued a temporary restraining order against the Defendants from violating these provisions.  Cohen has agreed to a permanent injunction against further violations of the Section 10 Rule and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. Cohen has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  A hearing on the matter is scheduled for October 5, 2017.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-0117 (January 9, 2017).  The Commission on Civil and Administrative Rights has issued an Order suspending the issuance, purchase, offer, and sale of any emergency relief that may be deemed necessary for the relief sought by the Commission. The Commission has also issued an order suspending"
