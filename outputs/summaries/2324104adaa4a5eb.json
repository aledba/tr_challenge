James, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for second- and third-degree murder in May 2015.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, alleges that James entered the basement of the Parrot-fa-Nalia dress shop on May 8, 2015, to participate in a party hosted by friends and family members. According to the complaint, James and one of his friends, Artadius \"Ta Ta\" Johnson, entered the room and confronted the defendant, telling him that he had just gotten out of prison and was \"mugging\" James throughout the night.

On August 19, 2019, the Honorable Judge John J. G. Sansone entered final judgments against James, ordering him to disgorge $1,078.71, pay a $100,000 civil penalty, and appoint a receiver to the receiver of the receiver's receiver.  Judge Sansone also ordered James to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, and ordered him to comply with the court's order.
