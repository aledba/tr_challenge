  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Richard Blech for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 15301(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 10, 2018, Richard alleges that the court improperly directed the trustee to withhold a portion of Richard's 2018 principal distribution until after the court issued its final order on the creditors' petitions.  The complaint further alleges that Richard's attorney, Robert C. Carmack, raised the issue of whether the court should order Richard to pay the full amount of his 2019 principal distribution to the creditors.  Richard's complaint alleges that, contrary to the court's order, the trustee failed to do so, and instead directed Richard to make all of the payments directly to the beneficiary.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Richard consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a total of $1.5 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Richard.  To learn more about trustee remedies, see Litigation Release No. 15301 (b).  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA) has issued an Investor Alert on Investor.gov to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commission\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly spot suspicious patterns. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint against Richard, filed in federal district court in New York, charges Richard with violating Section 15302 of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil money penalties, and a penny stock bar.   In its complaint, the SEC alleges that Carmack violated Sections 15301 and 15302, and that Richard violated Section 15303 by failing to comply with certain of those provisions of the exchange agreement, including that the trustee must make all distributions of principal before the trustee is required to make those distributions.  Specifically, the complaint seeks a permanent injunction against Richard from violating the above-mentioned provisions, a temporary restraining order, and an order directing the trustee not to make distributions until the court has determined or determines in its discretion whether to pay to the trustee."
