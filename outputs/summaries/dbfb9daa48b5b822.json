  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Maryland today entered a final judgment against Daniel T. Mills, a former Baltimore City Police Department officer who was convicted of felony drug possession.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore on March 21, 2016, Mills was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC alleges that, as alleged in the complaint, Mills failed to establish a prima facie case of race-based discrimination in the exercise of Peremptory Strikes against African-American defendants, including David Fitzgerald, a convicted felon, who was also convicted of possession of the drug.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Mills.  On March 24, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Mills, charging him with violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 5b2-1 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Rule 206(3) and (4)-8 thereunder and with prejudgment interest in the case.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson and Amy C. Welshhans in the Office of Advocacy and Advocacy."
