  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Nevada today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a family law case. The court found that Steve Sanson, president of Veterans in Politics International, Inc., and Louis C. Schneider, LLC, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Sanson also agreed to settle the charges by consenting to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar against Sanson. In addition, Sanson agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. In a parallel action, the Nevada Attorney General's Office today announced that it has filed an emergency action to freeze the assets of two of Sanson\u2019s law firms and to bar him from appearing before the SEC as an attorney or practicing before the court. The SEC also announced that Sanson has agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Nevada Secretary of State's Office and the Nevada Office of the Attorney General."
