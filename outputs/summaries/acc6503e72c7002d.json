  "summary": "The Kentucky Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order freezing the assets of Kentucky-based Braidy Industries, Inc., a company that received $15 million in tax incentives from the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, alleges that Kentucky Attorney General Matt Bevin and his agency, Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority (KEDFA), violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to disclose the names of the shareholders or investors in the company.  According to the complaint, the SEC alleges that the SEC's order, which was issued on April 26, 2017, required KEDFA to provide a list of the company's shareholders in order to determine whether it was entitled to a final judgment that would permit an unfair commercial advantage to the company or its shareholders.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in a parallel action, the Attorney General of Kentucky issued an order requiring the SEC to provide an accounting of its investments and related expenditures, which included the issuance of stock in a company and the purchase of a $1.3 billion stake in a private company. The SEC also requested that the names be withheld from the public as part of an investigation that was conducted by the Kentucky Office of Inspector General and the Kentucky Department of Commerce.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the Secretary of Justice's Office has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0OnInvestor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint charges the Kentucky Secretary Of State with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the defendants.  For further information, see SEC v. Kentucky Board of Examiners, 907 S.W.2d 766, 904 (Ky. 1992).  In a related administrative proceeding, the Department of Justice filed an emergency action in which it obtained a temporary restraining order against the SEC from further violations of the securities laws, including Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The court granted the SEC and the SEC the right to a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 10"
