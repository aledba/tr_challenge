  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of the California Department of Revenue and Taxation, which granted the agency's request for a temporary asset freeze and other emergency relief.  The court's order, which was entered yesterday, permanently enjoins the agency from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  In a parallel action, the California Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Olive Lane Industrial Park, LLC (Olive Lane).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, charges Olive Lane with violations of Section 5 of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Olive Lane consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(2)(A), and ordering her to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of her civil penalty.  Olive Lane also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any real property in violation of the above-mentioned provisions of the securities laws, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Finally, the court granted Olive Lane's motion for an emergency asset freeze, which is subject to court approval, to the issuance of a temporary restraining order and to the filing of a civil injunctive action.  According to the SEC's continuing investigation, the agency has been conducting an extensive internal review of its policies and procedures to determine whether it is appropriate to issue an asset freeze in the future and to consider other remedies.  On June 8, 2012, a federal district court in Los Angeles entered a judgment against the agency that issued the injunction, ordering it to comply with the court's orders, imposing a $1.5 million civil penalty, and ordering the agency to pay an $80,000 civil penalty in the event of a default judgment of the same nature as the property taken by the government.  At the same time, the district court issued an order requiring the County of San Diego to consider whether to issue a civil injunction against the issuance or purchase of any new real property, including the right to reapply after the date the property is acquired.  As a result, the county has been prohibited from issuing or selling any property without a court-ordered injunction, and the court has not issued any order imposing a preliminary injunction. "
