  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against defendant Trenton R. Birchette for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleges that, in a 2015 traffic stop of a vehicle with three occupants, a Mexican national, and an African-American juror made clear and explicit statements concerning the defendant\u2019s prior felony conviction and prior police interactions involving cocaine.  According to the complaint, the juror also allegedly told the officer that the two of them were only doing this because of race, and that he or she had to do it because of his or her vote to convict.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendant had a history of drug-related conduct, which could be used to impeach the jury.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's Complaint, the court ruled that the jury should be able to determine whether or not to remove a defendant from the jury based on the evidence presented in the Complaint. The court also ruled that a jury should not be forced to interview a defendant based on prejudgment evidence presented to the jury by a juror who was not a member of the jury, and therefore cannot determine whether to remove him or her.  On August 5, 2018, the Honorable Paul J. Burt of the U.N. Circuit Court in Alexandria entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Burt from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Burt also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years and to be prohibited from participating in any jury-based disciplinary proceeding. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing is scheduled for September 7, 2018. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Virginia State Attorney General's Office, and the Virginia Department of Criminal Justice."
