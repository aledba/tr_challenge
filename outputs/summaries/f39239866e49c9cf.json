  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment against Gerald Hill-White, a convicted arsonist who was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison for setting a fire that endangered at least five victims.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey on November 3, 2011, Hill-white was charged with one count of second-degree arson, which is a form of arson that occurs when a person intentionally sets fire to a building or building.  The complaint alleges that, in the days leading up to the fire, defendant sent K.G. threatening to kill her and telling her that she was \u201cdead.\u201d  The SEC further alleges that defendant set the fire in a closet next to a public house of worship.  As alleged in the complaint, the arson statute requires a defendant to be charged with multiple counts of arson, and that defendant must have \"purposeful\" and \"reckless\" conduct in the course of setting the fire.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and Criminal Justice announced that it has issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty.  On November 4, 2017, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the Federal Bureau of Investigation entered a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $150,000 and $100,000, respectively, for each of those charged with a second- and third-degree felony.   The final judgment also orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of $2,965, which represents the amount of their monetary losses, plus interest and penalties, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion of the SEC.  Finally, the court granted the SEC the right to a preliminary injunction against future violations, ordered the defendant to return to the criminal justice system, and ordered the destruction of any evidence that may be relevant to the case.  For further information, see State v. Miller, 206 N.J. 459, 206 A.D."
