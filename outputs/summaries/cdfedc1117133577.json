  "summary": "On June 6, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment in favor of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office in a parallel action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia on July 25, 2018, alleges that the Pennsylvania Department of Commerce issued an order requiring foreign corporations to register to do business in Pennsylvania and consent to general personal jurisdiction in violation of the Due Process Clause of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, the order required foreign companies to register with the department of commerce and, therefore, to have a sufficient basis of jurisdiction to perform their business in the state.  In addition, the court found that, by registering, a foreign corporation consented to the entry of a new standard of jurisdiction, without the presence of a specific jurisdiction, it is irretrievably inconsistent with the teachings of Daimler.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the imposition of a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that will be imposed by the court upon the foreign corporation.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 571, 571 (3d Cir. 1992).  The Court's order against Huntington Ingalls, which entered final judgments in the case on July 24, 2018 and unsealed on August 22, 2018 pursuant to the Federal Officer Removal Statute, requires a court to determine whether a corporation consents to jurisdiction by virtue of its receipt of a court order requiring it to show cause and effect in its jurisdiction.   The court's order also requires the company to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court that enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, and 13b2-3 thereunder.  It also requires that the company pay a penalty of at least $5,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Kiekert and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Philadelphia Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
