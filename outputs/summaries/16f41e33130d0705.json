  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Fred Samson, who was indicted by a grand jury on March 6, 2019, on two counts of stealing Social Security retirement benefits from his mother and father after they died.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, Samson was charged with stealing the Social Security benefits because his parents died in 1995 and his father and mother-in-law were widows.  The complaint alleges that Samson made numerous unauthorized withdrawals from the joint bank accounts of his parents, and then used the stolen funds to pay for his own living expenses.  As alleged in the complaint, however, Samson did not withdraw the stolen money from these accounts until 2017, when he withdrew the money from the bank accounts and withdrew it from the accounts.  To prove that Samson violated the federal securities laws, the court found that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he is entitled to a judgment of acquittal on the basis of that finding.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Samson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Samson.   The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check whether they are registered professionals by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint alleges that, contrary to the representations of the SEC\u00c2\u00a0in its Complaint, Samson violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and the return of allegedly stolen or misused funds.  For more information, see Investor Alert.gov, Investor Alerts.gov (Sept. 13, 2018).  The Commission on Investor Education has also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of investing in a fraudulent scheme to steal or misappropriate money.
