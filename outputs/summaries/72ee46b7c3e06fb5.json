  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Krsnaks in a civil injunctive action brought by the District of Columbia.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City on June 28, 2011, the Krnaks, who live a short distance from the new pond, brought an action against the District alleging a taking or damaging of their property and nuisance.  The complaint alleges that, in 2011, a federal district court in South Dakota granted a temporary restraining order against the construction of a sewage treatment pond.  In its order, the court ruled that the District violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the District to pay disgorgement of $82,800.00 plus prejudgment interest of $1,038.00, a civil penalty of $75,000, and a penny stock bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay civil penalties of $50,000 and $100,000. The court also granted the defendants the right to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest.  On June 6, 2016, the District filed a motion for summary judgment on their behalf, alleging that the defendants failed to adequately consider the nature of their injury and the possible cause of the damage.   The court granted the KRSnaks\u2019 motion to summary judgment, which is subject to court approval, on the basis of the facts contained in the SEC\u2019s complaint.  To learn more about inverse condemnation, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (January 24, 2020).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Environmental and Natural Resources, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
