  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of two counts of felony murder, MCL 750.316(1)(b) and first-degree child abuse.  According to the court's order, filed on March 14, 2015, the defendant and his then-girlfriend, together with their three children, EH, LH, and BH, were interviewed by a child psychologist in the course of an emergency medical examination conducted by Child Protective Services (CPS) to determine if BH's injuries could have been caused by a \"shaking-type trauma.\"  The court also found that defendant failed to disclose to the child psychologist that he had choked his son.  The Court's order also finds that defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against defendant.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, charges defendant with violating the mandatory registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) of Securities Act of 1933.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendant has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2,500, and imposes a $75,000 civil penalty.  On March 21, 2017, the court granted the SEC a temporary restraining order and ordered the SEC to conduct an examination of the evidence in the case.  To determine whether to proceed with the investigation, the SEC requested that the case be handled by a trial attorney, a judge, and a district attorney. The SEC also requested that a hearing be held on the matter of whether to impose a preliminary injunction, which would prohibit defendants from making or selling any statements to the SEC as part of a criminal proceeding.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 598 (2014).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Michigan Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
