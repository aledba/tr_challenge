  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against Starboard Cruise Services, Inc. (\"Starboard\"), a Florida-based cruise line, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Winter Park, Florida, Starboard offered to settle all of DePrince's claims for specific performance, breach of contract, and conversion, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The complaint alleges that Starboard's offer was conditional upon DePrince executing a release and dismissing with prejudice all of his claims.  The complaint further alleges that DePrince did not respond to the offer for settlement until just before trial, shortly before the proposal for settlement had been rejected by DePrince.  In a parallel action, on July 29, 2016, the SEC charged Starboard with violating Section 768.79 of the Exchange Act, and charged DePrince with violations of Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1.  Starboard agreed to settle with the SEC without admitting, denying, or denying all of its allegations, and agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt of the SEC Enforcement Division's Miami Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry and Mr. Bort. The case has been supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Florida Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Miami Office of the United States Attorney's Office."
