  "summary": "On January 15, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the Department of Defense, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California against Sigmatech, Inc.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that the Department has violated the antifraud provisions of Section 14(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rules 14b-5, 1340-28, and 13d-1 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the agency improperly attempted to set aside the work for small businesses and attempted to use a different contracting vehicle in order to circumvent the BPA procurement process but was unable to find enough contractors to compete for the work. Finally, the complaint alleges that after it protested this action, the Agency reissued the re-compete for \"full and open\" competition but delayed the project until it was able to bring new small businesses onto the project.  In a parallel action, on January 23, 2019 in the Eleventh Circuit, the Court of Federal Claims granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendant, and ordering the asset freeze and other emergency relief to be placed on the defendant.  On January 24, 2020, the SEC filed an emergency action against DigiFlight, Inc., a Texas-based company that had been barred from bidding for government contracts in the past, in violation of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, however, the defendant has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078, and prejudgment interest of $2,038, and requires him to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, including securities laws violations, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 or $20,000.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1491(1) and Litigation Bulletin No. 1382 (2nd ed.).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
