  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of South Carolina today entered a final judgment against Bostic Brothers Construction, Inc. and its general contractor, Rick Thoennes, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 15-38-50 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charleston, South Carolina, alleges that, from 2002 through 2004, Marick and Thoess engaged in a multi-pronged scheme to construct a townhouse community on Lake Keowee.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to disclose to the HOA's members that they were liable for material, non-existent, or permanent damages caused by the construction defects.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Marick failed to adequately disclose to his board members that he was the proximate cause of the property's damages.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal on June 5, 2004, the court found Marick liable for liability for breach of implied warranty of workmanlike services.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Marick also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay disgorgement of $2,144,088.23 plus prejudgment interest of $3,655, and a $1.4 million civil penalty for a total of $6,309,197, not including any compensation for the loss of his expectancy.  Additionally, the judgment requires the court to determine the amount of any civil penalties to be determined by the court at a later date.  For example, the SEC seeks a permanent injunction against Marick, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.   In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Thoiss.  On June 6, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Conrrad of the Southern Division of Criminal Justice issued a temporary restraining order, ordering Marick to comply with the court order, imposing a $5,000 civil penalty, and appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue a civil injunctive relief order.  A hearing on June 13, 2018 was scheduled for 8:30 a.m."
