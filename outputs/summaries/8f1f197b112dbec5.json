  "summary": "On March 22, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against BMO Harris Bank, N.A. and its co-defendant, Brian R. Porter, that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of these provisions.  According to the court's order, filed on February 13, 2015, defendants filed a third amended counterclaim, alleging breach of the implied-in-fact contract.  In its amended complaint, defendants alleged that defendants failed to pay interest as part of a 20-year loan, despite repeated requests by the lender to do so.  As alleged in the complaint, Defendants failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their assertion that the loan was in fact 20 years and that the lender was entitled to an extension of the maturity of the loan at issue.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the third amended, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating these provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  BMO agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  It also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for the rest of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.  On March 24, 2016, the court granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered BMO to comply with the court order. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Arleta A. and B.R.Porter. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
