  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc. (\"Orexigen\"), a biopharmaceutical company that develops and sells cardiovascular drugs.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, on May 12, 2015, the SEC obtained an emergency court order to halt an ongoing clinical trial of Contrave, a drug that is supposed to treat heart disease.  According to the complaint, the court found that, based on the SEC's findings, the company violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the company had a duty to inform investors about the 25 percent interim results when they received them.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to disclose to investors that Contrave had not received FDA approval for the drug, despite repeated requests to do so.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint or the allegations raised in the court's order, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requires them to submit a civil injunctive action against each of them. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  On June 27, 2016, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the United States District Court in Manhattan granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to comply with the court order. The court also issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of a case-by-case review of the matter. The order also prohibits defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including securities in the securities of a public company, and from making or selling a security. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal registration provisions, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  A hearing on June 26, 2016 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (Exhibit A).  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendants for their roles in the scheme. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov."
