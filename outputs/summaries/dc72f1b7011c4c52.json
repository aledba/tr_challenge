  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment in favor of the parties' motion for a divorce.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that Mark S. Buck and Janet Yackee Buck violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Buck and Buck's mother made $3,000 a month available to each of them each month to support their husbands' ongoing expenses and sometimes exorbitant lifestyle. The complaint further alleges that after the wedding, Mr. Buck deposited $3000 monthly transfers from his mother into a joint account where the sums were co-mingled with the funds from the personal injury settlement.  As set forth in the SEC's judgment, the parties failed to adequately consider the facts of the case and failed to determine whether the settlement award was equitable.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Buck.  On December 18, 2017, the trial court issued a judgment ordering Buck to pay $5,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his civil penalty.  Buck agreed to the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint and to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil monetary penalty of $10,000. The judgment also prohibits Buck from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in any offering of a penny stock. The settlement is subject to court approval. The court also ordered Buck to disgorge $692,592.40 in prejudgment interests and pay $49,975.08 in civil money market fees. The SEC previously issued an order requiring Buck to comply with a court order requiring him to provide a copy of the judgment to the court.   The court's order also requires Buck to provide an accounting of his assets, including his wife's retirement savings, and to provide for the payment of any civil penalty in the future.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 3105.171(A)(3)(B).  The complaint charges Buck with violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 and Rule 15a-3 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of the Exchange Act and Rules 15b-20, 13a-1, 13b-11, and 13d-13 thereunder; and a conduct-based injunction against further violations of"
