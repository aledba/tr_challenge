  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Joseph Milcoun, a Texas resident who filed a civil injunctive action in 2014 alleging that he was injured by a Keller ladder sometime in May 2014.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Dallas, alleges that MilCoun, who lives in Houston, Texas, was falsely told that Keller Ladders, Inc. was acquired by Werner in 2014 and was no longer in business.  According to the complaint, after learning that Werner did not manufacture or design the ladder, he filed a motion for summary judgment on the basis that he had failed to exercise diligence in serving KLI.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that, in reality, Milcouvenier did not do any due diligence at all.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants failed to timely serve KLI because they did not have sufficient evidence to show that they had acted as a proper party to the KLI litigation.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations in the Complaint or its findings in the Commissioned Inquiry, the Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants a temporary restraining order and an order freezing the assets of the defendants and prohibiting them from using the funds for their personal use.  On May 22, 2017, the trial court granted a summary judgment in favor of the Defendants on the affirmative defense of limitations, and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.   The defendants also agreed to be barred from serving as officers or directors of a public company.  Finally, the Court granted the Defendants\u2019 request for a court-ordered continuance of the proceedings.  A hearing on June 9, 2017 was conducted by Mark Parsky, an attorney in private practice in Chicago, Illinois, who had recently represented the defendants in litigation against Werner.  Parsky and his firm agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to comply with the court order requiring them to provide timely and accurate information about the status of the litigation. The defendants agreed to pay civil penalties of $500,000 and $1 million, respectively. The settlements are subject to court approval."
