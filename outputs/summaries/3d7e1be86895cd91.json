  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Department of Health and Human Services (OHHS) in a pay data collection case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the OHS violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that OHS failed to comply with the reporting requirements of the EEO-1, and that OMB failed to provide timely and accurate information about the pay gap. OMB also failed to inform its members that it was collecting the information in the form of a \"summary\" of pay data that would be used to determine whether an employer had violated the federal reporting requirements.  OMB's final judgment, which was entered on September 15, 2017, permanently enjoins OHS from violating the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Exchange Act and Rule\u00c2\u00a05(b)(5) thereunder, and orders OMB to pay a civil penalty, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The court also granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against OMB from further violations of the reporting provision of the Exchange Act.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order suspending the collection of information from OMB. The agency has also agreed to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from future violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 and Rule 15a-2 thereunder and to pay an $80,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of the Inspector General in this matter."
