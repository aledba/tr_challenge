  "summary": "On December 9, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a final judgment against Clifford Gandy Jr., a Florida man who was convicted of battery of a jail detainee, in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered an order suspending Gandy from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Orlando, Gandy agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a penalty of 360 months to life imprisonment.  Gandy also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any form of controlled-substance, including, without limitation, possession of a firearm, with the intent to commit a felony, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Florida today announced criminal charges against Gandy.  On December 11, 2010, a jury found Gandy guilty of battery upon a jail visitor or other detainee, and he was sentenced to a prison term ranging from 360 to 300 months.  After a two-day trial, the jury convicted Gandy on all of the charges, and Gandy pleaded guilty to one count of battery on a prison detainee.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the defendant agreed to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing a $1,000,000 civil penalty.  He also was ordered to pay restitution of $2,500, which he will pay in a civil penalty of 300 months to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of the Attorney General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
