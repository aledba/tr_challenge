  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the SEC in April 2014.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas, alleges that defendants Danny Brown and Toni Boydston violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Brown and Boydston failed to maintain adequate insurance coverage on the Mayflower property and failed to convert the $450,000 check to the $10,000 insurance check.  Brown also failed to disclose to the court that he had converted the check into an actual-cash-value insurance check and that he was liable for $230,000 in punitive damages for the same amount.

Additionally, the court found that Brown was liable as a party to a civil action for breach of contract for his conduct in connection with the purchase of a home and for the payment of a mortgage on the same property.   The court also found Brown liable for prejudgment interests based on his receipt of the check and, thus, granted him the right to redeem the check as an accord and satisfaction of all the parties' claims against him.  For further information, see Litigation Release Order No. 17-cv-8221 (2014).  The complaint also alleges that Brown and his wife, Toni, failed to adequately represent to the SEC that they were not entitled to the same level of compensation as they were entitled to under the lease.  Finally, the complaint seeks a permanent injunction against Brown and the imposition of civil penalties against him, and an order requiring him to disgorge his gains with prejud"
