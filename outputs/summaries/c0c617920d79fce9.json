  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Oregon today announced criminal charges against a California man accused of making a series of unprovoked and unprovable threats to himself and others.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, alleges that, while on the train, appellant experienced auditory hallucinations and believed that people were trying to harm him. He also allegedly had an encounter with the police while he was in the process of obtaining an enhanced identification card in the State of Washington.  According to the complaint, after the train stopped at a stoplight, appellant allegedly left a threatening voicemail to Governor Brown, telling her that he was going to make an arrest, take anyone into custody, or otherwise act out on his belief that he is a bounty hunter.  As alleged, however, the voicemail was not followed by an overt act of violence.  In addition, the complaint alleges that appellant did not engage in any overt acts of violence in the past, and instead cooperated with the train conductor, who asked him to move to the lower compartment of the train so that he could get his daily dose of medication.   The complaint further alleges that the train driver confronted appellant and told him that he had a history of making threats to others, and that he believed he was a danger to himself.  He also claimed that he received treatment in the community and did well, despite having been barred from that office location in the fall of 2014.  On September 14, 2015, the trial court held a commitment hearing for a hearing on whether to proceed with a criminal charge against appellant. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against appellant and ordered him to return to the United States.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $10,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Oregon Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
