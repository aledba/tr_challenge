  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Hempstead Public Schools Board of Education and Susan Johnson, the school district's former principal, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, on July 20, 2015, the Board and Superintendent held a public meeting at the school to discuss the district's plans to transform its high school and junior high school into community schools.  The court found that the Board's decision to prohibit the use of video or recording equipment in the meeting violated the First Amendment.  In a parallel action, the New York State Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Johnson.  As alleged in the SEC's complaint, Johnson was not required to participate in a training session on Open Meetings Law.  Instead, the court imposed a temporary restraining order, barring her from appearing or practicing before the board, and barring all members of the public from using their cameras to photograph or record the same.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Johnson consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay disgorgement of her ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,500, and requires her to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school for five years.  Johnson has also agreed to pay a $100,000 civil penalty and to be permanently enjoined from participating in any future public school board meetings or any other school-related activity.  On August 2, 2018, the U. S. District Judge in Manhattan granted the SEC request for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the anti-fraud provisions, ordered Johnson to comply with the court order, and ordered him to pay an $8,500 civil penalty.  Last week, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Johnson, charging her with violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4), and with aiding and abetting violations of Section 9(a)(1) of The Securities Act.  This case is being handled by David Siegel, Chief of the Public Education Division of the Department of Education, and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Education's Office of Inspections and Examinations. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Pennsylvania, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
