  "summary": "On October 2, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri entered a final judgment against Missouri First, Inc., a non-profit organization that uses legislative lobbying to influence public policy and to avoid the fact or appearance of corruption.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Missouri City, Missouri, alleges that Missouri First violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to register as a lobbyist.  According to the complaint, Calzone, who is paid to represent Missouri First in the Missouri House of Representatives, regularly meets with legislators, legislative staff, and other legislative groups to discuss Missouri legislation and to file lobbying reports. The complaint alleges that, in 2014 and 2016, the Missouri State Ethics Commission found probable cause to believe that Calzone violated the federal registration and reporting requirements for legislative lobbyists. Calzone then sought a writ of prohibition from the court, finding that the Missouri statute does not differentiate between paid and unpaid lobbyists and that requiring unpaid lobbyists to register with the government is substantially related to furthering that transparency interest.  Calzone also alleges that he did not receive any compensation or make any expenditures when lobbying on behalf of Missouri First.  In addition, he alleges that the SEC violated his First Amendment right to freedom of speech when he solicited new members to help further advance Missouri First\u2019s legislative agenda.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, Missouri First has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions, orders it to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, and orders Calzone to pay disgorgement of $2,965, which is equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requires him to pay an $80,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On October 3, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Calzone for violating the registration and disclosure requirements. The SEC previously issued an order requiring Missouri First to register and report as lobbyists, which Calzone has agreed to do. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Minnesota today announced criminal charges against him.  A hearing scheduled for November 5, 2019 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 24, 2019).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, and Kurt L. Gottschall, Regional Director of the Missouri Office of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson."
