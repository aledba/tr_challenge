  "summary": "On July 26, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a final judgment against Wendy Younger, a Texas resident, in a takings claim against El Paso County Emergency Services District No. 2.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in El Paso, Younger purchased the lot at issue in the Montana Vista area in 1997 as part of an agreement between the Paso View Christian Association and the Montana Vista Volunteer Fire Department. The complaint alleges that the County made her property unmarketable when it lost her original deed, losing it, and failing to acquire a replacement deed. The SEC alleges that, in reality, the County did not do any of these things, and Younger was unable to obtain a title policy for her property.  The complaint further alleges that when she went to inquire about the missing deeds with the County Attorney\u2019s Office, she was offered replacement deeds at no charge.  Younger, who was a member of the volunteer fire department, agreed to work the station and purchased one of the lots with her husband for $4,700.  She also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  As alleged in the complaint, however, this settlement is untimely because the trial court improperly granted Younger an opportunity to amend her pleadings and granted her the opportunity to do so.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Younger arising from the same conduct alleged by the complaint.  On July 24, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Younger, charging her with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Texas Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Younger consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, imposes a civil penalty, and requires her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and Eric R. Werner of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Werner. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Office of Inspector General in this matter."
