  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against a Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFS) conservator who was found liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court entered the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Houston, Texas, DFS terminated Michael's parental rights in June 2016. The complaint alleges that Michael was in a physical fight with someone at an apartment complex while being supervised by his mother, C.A.R. (Mother) and his father, A.E. (Father). The complaint also alleges that the Department failed to adequately evaluate the safety and well-being of the child. The court also found that Mother violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act by failing to provide sufficient evidence to justify her termination.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Mother. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David A. Kasper of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Eric R. Birkenheier and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The case has been supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Criminal Justice Unit.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 545 (Aug. 7, 2018).
