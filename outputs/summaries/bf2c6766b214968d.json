  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Shawn A. Grant, a Belgrade, Me., resident, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The court's order, which was entered on May 3, 2018, permanently enjoins Grant from future violations of the federal securities laws.  According to the order, Grant, who resides at 21 Hulin Road, has agreed to settle the charges by agreeing to a permanent injunction and to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Grant.  Grant also agreed to pay $1,500 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Grant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating these provisions, and ordering him to pay an $80,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 penalty.  On May 4, 2018 the U. S. District Judge granted Grant's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to return to Belgrade to present his case to the court. The court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered Grant to show cause why he should not be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The order also prohibits Grant from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of any company or entity with which he has an interest in acquiring or selling a security deposit. The Court also granted Grant the right to reapply as a municipal judge in the future.  To learn more about pre-judgment review, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 26, 2015).
