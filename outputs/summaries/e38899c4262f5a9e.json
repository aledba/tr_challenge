  "summary": "On May 18, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York entered a final judgment against George Williams, a former corrections officer who was charged with misconduct in a civil action brought by Williams.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Buffalo, New York, Warner, a corrections officer, and three others were named as defendants in an administrative proceeding arising out of the alleged August 9, 2011 assault on Williams. The complaint alleges that Warner, Swack, and Rademacher violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint further alleges that the defendants acted outside the scope of their employment when, for example, they kicked and punched Williams in the head and body, slammed him against a wall, and threw him down the stairs.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Warner consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the New York Office of Inspector General and the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations. The litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Criminal Division. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The investigation was supervised by Jennifer C. Barry and Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office."
