  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against Nusret Miami, LLC, a Florida-based restaurant, and three other individuals for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that, between October 17, 2018 and November 16, 2018, the defendants entered into an arbitration agreement that required them to arbitrate employment claims.  According to the complaint, the arbitration agreement also required each of the defendants to sign a copy of the agreement and to submit an offer of consent to participate in the litigation.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to comply with the arbitration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 5(b)(2)(A) of their contracts, and failed to timely respond to their requests for documents and interrogatories.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requiring them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $20,000.  Additionally, the court has ordered the parties to sign an arbitration memorandum that provides for the issuance of an order appointing an independent arbitrator.  On May 7, 2019, the SEC filed an emergency action against the defendants, charging them with violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of its Investment Advisers Act and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting the defendants' violations of Section 13(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and Rule 13b2-2 thereunder of the Exchange Act and Rules 13b-14 and 13b3-3 thereunder; and, charging the defendants with violating Section 15(e) of The Exchange Act by failing to provide sufficient evidence to show that the parties had waived their right to arbitration and that they had violated Section 15e-1(a).  The complaint also charges the parties with violating Exchange Act Rule 13d-20 and Rule 12d-13 thereunder and with violating Rule 13e-20.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-CV-60781-1 (Jan. 24, 2019).  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the three defendants.   The U."
