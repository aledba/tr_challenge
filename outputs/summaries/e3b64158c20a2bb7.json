  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Sebastian Durstock, Jr., a Lawrenceburg, Minnesota man, for his role in a January 2017 drug-related arrest.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, on January 13, 2017, officers conducted a pat down search of an apartment in Lawrenceburg for a suspected drug dealer. The officers found a loaded handgun wrapped in a wet bandana, digital scales, men's clothing, and men's deodorant. According to the complaint, the officers' discovery of the gun made them suspicious, and they immediately arrested Durstock for possession of the drug. The complaint further alleges that Durstock consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of seventeen and one-half years. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against Durstock. Durstock agreed to the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement is pending final approval by the court. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
