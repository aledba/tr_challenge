  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a motion to dismiss a complaint filed by a musical theater company and its owner, alleging that Lee Schreiber violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, on April 21, 2015, Schreib and his company, Pastime LLC, agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties.  The judgment also orders Pastime to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 24, 2017, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Brooklyn, N.Y., alleging that, in violation of Section 13(a) of Exchange Act Rule 12(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and that Pastime has agreed to a settlement that is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions of the Exchange Act and to be barred from future securities law violations.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of the Chief of the New York Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to be wary of investing in any investment that may be made in a company that does not already have an ownership of a musical.  For example, on May 22, 2014, Burt pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.  As a result of his actions, Pastimes agreed to pay $1.5 million in restitution and a $100,000 civil penalty, and the settlement is pending approval by the court. "
