  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Indiana today entered a preliminary injunction against Indiana's new parental notification requirement for minors seeking abortions.  The court granted the request for a temporary restraining order and entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins Indiana from violating the parental notification provisions of the federal parental notification requirements for minors.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Indianapolis, Indiana, Planned Parenthood of Indiana, Inc., and its parent, legal guardian, and custodian have agreed to settle the case by consenting to pre-judgment judgments that impose an undue burden on the right to an abortion. The court also granted the motion for preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval.  In its order, the court found that Indiana's parental notification provision is inconsistent with federal law and requires that a judge determine whether a person is sufficiently mature to make a reasonable decision about whether an abortion should be performed without parental notice.  Without admitting or denying the court\u2019s finding, the Court found that the parental notice provision is a reasonable tool for preventing an abortion from being performed without the parents\u2019 knowledge or consent.  Planned Parenthood has also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public health organization for five years.  For additional information, see the\u00c2\u00a0Advocacy Action Network's\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0January\u00c2\u00a020, 2018.\u00c2\u00a0On March 22, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Planned Parenthood, alleging that it violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC's complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Indiana Department of Health, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, and the Indiana Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
