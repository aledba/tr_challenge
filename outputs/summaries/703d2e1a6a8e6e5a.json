  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a former Israeli defense minister for his role in an Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that Barak aided and abetted Israel\u2019s violations of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, and that he was not entitled to foreign official immunity under the federal law.  According to the complaint, Barak was among the Israeli defense ministers who participated in an operation to intercept a Hamas-controlled flotilla that was about to sail through the Israeli naval blockade.  Barak allegedly directed the operation himself, directed the IDF to board and take over the vessel, and personally authorized the use of lethal force.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the Israeli Defense Ministry had filed a motion to dismiss on the basis that it did not have sufficient evidence to determine whether Barak should be entitled to common law immunity.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the Israeli Attorney General has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Barak from violating the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Separately, the United States Attorney General and Secretary of State have issued an order appointing a temporary restraining order against Barak and ordering him to comply with the court order.  On May 31, 2010, a group of six vessels, calling themselves the \u201cGaza Freedom Flotilla,\u201d sailed from Turkey toward the Israeli coast. The Israeli government expressly denied that Marcos\u2019 conduct had been performed in an official capacity and urged that the lawsuits be allowed to proceed.  As alleged in the complaint and declarations filed by the Do\u011fans, however, this is not the case where Barak is entitled to immunity, because he was never given immunity in the first place. In fact, the court found that, as in the case before it, the Israel Defense Ministry violated the foreign sovereign immunity provisions of the federal laws and ordered Barak to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Finally, the U.K. Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed a civil action in the matter of an Israeli citizen who died during an Israeli military operation.   The U."
