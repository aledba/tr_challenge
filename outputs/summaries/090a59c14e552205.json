  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska today entered a final judgment against Texas Mutual Insurance Company, Inc., a company that provided workers' compensation insurance for the repair and replacement of single family dwellings anywhere in the continental United States.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Omaha, Nebraska, alleges that CMR Construction & Roofing of Texas, LLC (CMR), was the statutory employer of Martinez when it entered into an insurance contract with a business it knew operated across state lines. CMR's complaint alleges that the compensation court erred in finding that Martinez had reached maximum medical improvement from his injuries and was entitled to an award of future medical care. The complaint further alleges that, in response to Martinez' third set of requests for admissions, CMR declined to award Martinez temporary partial disability benefits.  According to the complaint, the SEC's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins CMR from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 48-116 of the federal securities laws, and orders CMR to pay $52,980.58 in medical and physical therapy expenses.  CMR has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating these provisions, ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, and ordering CMR liable for the payment of attorney fees to Martinez.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against CMR for its role in this matter.  On March 12, 2015, a federal district court in Nebraska issued an order granting CMR partial partial disability insurance. The court found that the amount of the compensation amount owed to Martinez was insufficient to determine whether CMR was liable for a penalty for waiting time or for allowance of attorneys fees. In a related action, on October 26, 2017, the same court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered a hearing on Martinez's motion for summary judgment on March 24, 2018. The hearing was conducted in the absence of any evidence to support the court's finding. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau and Ms. Mascianica. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Nebraska Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Nebraska Office of Insurance Regulation."
