  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a former Oklahoma City, Oklahoma resident for his role in a drug conspiracy.  According to the SEC's complaint, on January 26, 2017, officers learned that Antonio Martinez, a convicted drug dealer, was traveling from Oklahoma City to Tulsa to purchase a car. The complaint alleges that Martinez and another defendant, Joel Ulloa, were driving the car when they intercepted the car and informed the officers that Garcia was going to pick up methamphetamine from Garcia. Garcia allegedly told them that he had received the methamphetamine from the truck and that he would meet him at the gas station, where he would be waiting to deliver the drug. The SEC alleges that Garcia replied to the officer\u2019s question about the availability of additional witnesses, saying that he did not know about the drugs in the truck. Garcia also allegedly told the officer that he was planning on purchasing a car there with the approximately $20,000 in cash he was carrying.  The complaint further alleges that the officer told Garcia that he knew nothing about the drug deal and that the truck was traveling with him to ensure that the deal was completed.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California today entered a final judgment against Garcia, ordering him to pay a penalty of 170 months in prison. The final judgment, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins Garcia from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Garcia to comply with the entry of a judgment that imposes a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws. The court also ordered Garcia to pay restitution in the amount of $1,000,000 and a $100,000 civil penalty in a parallel criminal case.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Garcia consented to the issuance of the final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations. The judgment also imposes a five-year mandatory minimum and a 10-year suspension of the defendant from participating in a federal drug conspiracy, with the option to apply for a lower-level prison sentence. Garcia agreed to settle the SEC action by consenting to a judgment which imposes a mandatory minimum of five years in prison and a six-month suspension from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the U."
