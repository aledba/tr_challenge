  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of George II, a convicted felon who was sentenced to a total 259-month sentence for multiple crimes stemming from his drug-dealing and identity-theft activities.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, George, who was previously sentenced to 259 months in prison for identity theft and identity theft, used the proceeds from his illegal activities to pay for, among other things, more drugs and exotic car rentals.  The complaint alleges that George was a \"con man\" who supported his extravagant lifestyle with his criminal history, had participated in numerous self-help and rehabilitation programs, tutored other inmates, and wrote an anti-bullying book.  George also told the court that he was now a different man than who he was at initial sentencing.  In addition, the complaint alleges, George had engaged in numerous \"proactive activities\" while incarcerated, and made major self-adjustments, including accepting responsibility for his actions rather than blaming others, when he realized the harmful impact his actions had on his family members.  Finally, the SEC alleges that, in a second resentencing, George was convicted on six felony counts: (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine and a detectable amount of marijuana, (2) possession of a different firearm, (3) being a felon, and (4) committing Hobbs Act robbery, in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, (5) as well as aiding and abetting George II\u2019s violations of Section 3553(c)(1) and (3).  The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.   The case was supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
