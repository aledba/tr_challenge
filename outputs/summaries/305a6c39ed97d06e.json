  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against Wilson County Schools, Inc., a private school district, and its principal, who are charged with violating the federal anti-discrimination laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Nashville, Tennessee, alleges that Wilson County schools violated the antifraud provisions of Section 14(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 14b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the school district and school district initially refused to permit Sophie to attend Kid\u2019s Club, a private after-school program for children with disabilities. The complaint alleges that, in September 2016, one of Sophie's classroom aides spoke with the on-site coordinator on her behalf to determine whether Sophie could attend the program because she was not toilet trained. The court found that the IEP, which is designed to meet the needs of a child with a disability, does not provide support services for specific educational goals, such as toileting needs, and that the services listed did not adequately support the associated educational goals.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Wilson County agreed to the entry of a final judgement that permanently enjoins the defendants from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders the school to comply with the required administrative remedies, and orders the district to pay a civil penalty of $25,000.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the district court also issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendants\u2019 assets, and ordering the restitution to be determined by the court at a later date.  On May 24, 2017, the Honorable Joseph F. Schumacher of the United States District Court in Jackson, Tenn., granted the SEC request for a preliminary injunction against future violations, and ordered the district attorney to issue an order appointing a receiver to oversee the investigation. The SEC previously issued an order freezing the assets of certain Wilson County school districts and ordering them to pay civil penalties of $20,000 and $1,500, respectively.  To learn more about pre-judgment injunctions, see Litigation Release No. 1415(a)(1)(A) and Rules 12b-20, 13b2-1, 13a-11, and 13b3-13 thereunder, and to provide an accounting of the assets and liabilities of the affected school districts."
