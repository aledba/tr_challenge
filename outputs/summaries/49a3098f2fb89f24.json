  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Papalote Creek II, LLC (Papalote), a Texas-based company that planned to build an 87-turbine wind farm in Texas.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Dallas, alleges that, in 2009, the Texas Department of Commerce entered into a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Papalota Creek II that required it to purchase all of the energy generated by the wind farm at a fixed price for an 18-year term.  According to the complaint, however, the arbitration clause does not apply to performance-related disputes. Rather, the complaint alleges that the parties agreed upon a broad interpretation of the arbitration agreement and that, under the agreement, LCRA's liability for failing to take part in the project could be capped at $60 million.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On June 1, 2016, the district court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the parties to submit to binding arbitration. The court also granted the parties' request for an expedited hearing to determine whether to proceed with an asset freeze and other emergency relief.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about arbitration, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221. The SEC encourages investors to check the background of anyone offering them an investment by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about potential conflicts of interest arising out of or related to this matter.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC Investor.gov website to quickly and easily identify whether to invest in an investment that is not subject to the arbitration provisions of the federal securities laws.  For example, the SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter, but acknowledges the need for an independent arbitrator to determine the scope of any potential conflict. \u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the Commission of Inquiry has issued an\u00c2\u00a0investor caution\u00c2\u00a0in\u00c2\u00a0"
