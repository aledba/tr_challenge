  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Oklahoma City Fire Chief Andrew Young, Jr. for his alleged role in a conduct that led to his termination.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Oklahoma City, alleges that, while working as a fire chief in Idabel, Oklahoma, Mr. Young raised the issue of whether he was required to work a set shift as fire chief because of his race.  According to the complaint, he was not required to record his time worked on times sheets when he was asked to do so.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the fire chief had no evidence to support his termination, and that he did not know that his employer had asked him to change his work schedule.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Young consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $10,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Office of Inspector General, and is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Foshee-Thomas. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Oklahoma State Department of Insurance, and the Oklahoma Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
