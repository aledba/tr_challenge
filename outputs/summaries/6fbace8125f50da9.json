The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that Uretek failed to show that it was fraudulently induced to enter into a June 2010 agreement with the Mexican government that provided the right to sell its products and services in Mexico.  According to the complaint, the Mexican company entered into the agreement without admitting or denying any of the allegations in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the company, its president Brent Barron and its vice president, Randall Brown, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(3) of Exchange Act Rules 206(4)-8 thereunder.
