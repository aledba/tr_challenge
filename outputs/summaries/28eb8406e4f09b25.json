  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Dish Network Corp. (Dish) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, in 2013 and 2014, the Commission issued an order requiring Dish to pay a $1.564 billion penalty for violating Section 316 of the Communications Act. The Commission then granted Dish's request for a waiver of certain AWS-4 licenses. The complaint alleges that the Commission failed to consider the merits of the Commission\u2019s recommendation, and that Dish failed to comply with its obligations under Section 309.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Dish.  According to the complaint, in 2012, as part of an effort to address the growing need for wireless broadband, the FCC granted Dish a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, which delayed the issuance of the emergency court order. The court granted the SEC and the Federal Bureau of Investigation an emergency asset freeze and a temporary asset freeze.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&eau\u0099s complaint, the court also ordered the Commission to conduct an independent review of its order, which it did not consider.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Donnelly of the U.N. Court of Appeals for the District of Connecticut granted the Commission and the agency a temporary injunction, freezing the defendants\u2019 assets, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The Court also granted the agency and the receiver of the receiver a temporary bar.   The court will determine the amount of money to be distributed to the receiver and the amount to be spent on the receiver.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (January 17, 2018).  The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, and Antonia Chion. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Office of Regulatory Affairs (OIEA) in this matter."
