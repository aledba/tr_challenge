  "summary": "On June 9, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina entered a final judgment against a former school board member for failing to properly serve a petition for judicial review of school board decisions.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that Anthony Butler, a career teacher who was terminated by the school board in 2016, failed to adequately serve his petition on the Board of Education.  According to the complaint, Butler filed a petition on 9 May 2016 in which he alleged that a number of errors existed in the petition and that the Board had recommended that Butler serve the petition upon the Board. The complaint further alleges that Butler failed to serve the Board with his petition within the ten-day time limit required by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  The complaint also alleges that, in the wake of the Board\u2019s decision not to renew the contract of an assistant principal, Butler was placed on suspension without pay and that his dismissal had been recommended to the Board by the board. The Board subsequently entered an order terminating his contract of employment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's action, Butler consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 150B-46 of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for North Carolina today announced criminal charges against Butler. The SEC also announced that it has filed an emergency action against Butler, charging him with violating the anti-fraud provision of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting Butler's violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder. The court also issued an order suspending Butler from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  On June 11, 2016, the Honorable Tanya T. Wallace granted the SEC request for an emergency court order halting Butler's pending reappointment as a public school district attorney. The case was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Public Education Division, and the Division of Education's Office of Education Education and Advocacy. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans."
