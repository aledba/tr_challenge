  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment in favor of Louisiana residents and part owners of several limited liability companies and Subchapter S corporations that transact business in Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, alleges that the Department of Revenue of the State of Louisiana violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  The complaint further alleges that Louisiana residents paid a $23,180.00 income tax credit to Texas residents for income taxes paid to another state.  According to the complaint, this credit is not available to a taxpayer who is not registered to pay income taxes in Texas.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Texas did not offer a reciprocal credit for income tax paid to Louisiana residents.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the Texas franchise tax is not a tax on net income because it contains both a net income component and a net capital component, which are not divisible.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the federal district court for the southern district of Louisiana, the SEC has agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins Louisiana residents from violating the dormant Commerce Clause of the federal securities laws and orders the state to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their income tax owed to the federal government.  Additionally, the court has ordered Louisiana residents to pay an $8,500 civil penalty, which is subject to the same determination as Texas residents who paid the franchise tax.  On May 24, 2015, the U. S. District Judge for the Northern District of New Orleans entered a judgment against Louisiana residents in a civil action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Florida against Texas residents, who were charged with violating the federal registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d).  The court also issued a temporary restraining order halting the issuance of the Form 10-Q, which requires the filing of a civil injunctive action against the violators of the dormant commerce provision.   In a parallel action, on May 26, 2019, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued an order appointing a receiver to determine whether or not to issue an emergency asset freeze to prevent future violations of the anti-fraud provisions.  Sansone and Sansone agreed to the appointment of a receiver that would determine whether to issue the asset freeze as part of an ongoing investigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0"
