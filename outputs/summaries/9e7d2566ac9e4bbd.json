  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of kidnapping to commit robbery and second degree robbery.  The court found defendant guilty on all counts of kidnapping, robbery, and second-degree robbery and sentenced him to seven years to life.  According to the court's order, filed on May 13, 2013, the defendant and codefendant entered the apartment complex where S.A. was living with his fianc\u00c3\u0080\u0099s mother and two children. The court also found that the defendants did not commit robbery, but rather acted as a principal in the commission of the two robberies.  In addition, the court found that defendant had no history of criminal history and had no prior felony convictions for robbery or second degree robberies, and that he did not have a history of felony convictions.  As alleged in the SEC's complaint, the defendants had been in possession of a Mossburg shotgun since at least March 2013, and had used it to commit a series of home invasions, including one in which the defendant was shot in the shoulder and hip and another in the leg.  One of the defendants, who was also a convicted felon, was also charged with a felony for his role in the scheme.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On May 24, 2014, the jury deliberated for two hours before finding defendant guilty of one count of kidnapping and two counts of second- degree robbery based on the discovery of a handgun in a woman's backpack approximately three months after the robberies of S. A. and A.L.G., and ordered him to remove the gun from his possession.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Deon Hopkins and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the New York Police Department. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background\u00c2\u00a0of people selling investments by\u00c2\u00a0using\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2"
