  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Minnesota today entered a final judgment against a Minnesota-based trucking company and its former owner in an arbitration case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Minnesota, alleges that, in December 2016, Dart Transit Company hired Kimberly Byars as a truck driver to transport trailers and freight for its shipping customers.  According to the complaint, Ms. Byars signed contracts with Dart and Mainstream Transportation, Inc., both of which included arbitration provisions.  As alleged, the arbitration provisions in those contracts are unenforceable because they require that a party to sign a contract to arbitrate a dispute be subject to a minimum level of impartiality required under the federal arbitration rules.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the arbitration provision in the contracts does not require a reasonable right to consult an attorney before signing the agreement.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, Plaintiff has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering her to pay a civil penalty of $25,000, which is equal to the amount of her disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the settlement.  Further, the settlement is subject to court approval.  On June 19, 2019, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Donnelly of the United States District Court in Minnesota entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants, freezing their assets, and barring them from further violations of the federal securities laws.  Donnelly agreed to a permanent injunction, which prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, and to a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from acting as an officer or director of a publicly-traded company. The court also granted a preliminary injunction against future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 5(d) of\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0Federal Arbitration Rules, which require parties to submit arbitration judgments to a court having jurisdiction over an arbitration proceeding.   The court's order also prohibits Donnelly from associating with any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and from imposing a penny stock bar on anyone who signs an arbitration agreement that does not meet the bar's bar.  Additionally, Donnelly has agreed to the appointment of an independent arbitrator who will evaluate the merits of the arbitration and determine whether there is sufficient evidence to justify an injunction. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Messer Griesheim of the Chicago Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by"
