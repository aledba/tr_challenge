  "summary": "On September 14, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against Maverick Capital Management, LLC, an entity controlled by Lehman Brothers.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, in 2005, the bankruptcy court issued an order temporarily restraining Maverick from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 562 of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005.  According to the complaint, the court found that, contrary to the stated intent of the court, Maverick was entitled to a right to terminate certain of the contracts at the time the agreement became effective and to compute a termination amount based on the value of the contract at that time.  In a parallel action, on September 22, 2009, the same court issued a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins the parties from violating these provisions, and orders Maverick to pay a $30 million civil penalty in the event of a default.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of Sections 562 and 562, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of $101.9 million, prejudgment interest of $1.2 million, and a civil penalty of $10,000.   The court also denied Maverick's motion for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 562 (March 30, 2012).  The complaint also alleges that the court improperly restrained the filing of a civil injunctive action against Lehman, and that it issued an emergency asset freeze and asset freeze order on September 15, 2008, in which Lehman entered into a pre-judgment agreement that required it to suspend trading in certain of its securities contracts in an event of default, and to pay civil penalties of $150,000 and $100,000, respectively.  It also ordered Maverick not to participate in any offering of any security in connection with Lehman's bankruptcy proceedings.  Finally, the complaint alleges that Lehman failed to adequately disclose to the court that it had entered into an agreement with the trustee that it would not be liable for any loss arising from a default, provided that the trustee had the authority to determine the amount of any loss resulting from such a default and to appoint a trustee in a case where Lehman was insolvent. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0"
