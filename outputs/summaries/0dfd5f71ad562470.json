  "summary": "On August 11, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle East and Africa.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Tawfeeq, who lives in Atlanta and commends his work as a CNN staff member, has been barred from entering the country for a period of ninety days by the federal government.  In a parallel action, the court issued a temporary restraining order on January 29, 2017 that temporarily suspended the entry of foreign nationals from six specified countries for a total of 90 days.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the court's order, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  On August 13, 2018, the Court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered a hearing on the merits of the case, and ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively, for violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and Rules 5a-5, 5b-11, and 13a-13 thereunder, and issued an order requiring the defendants return to the country after 90 days to comply with the court order.   The court also granted the parties' request for a hearing to determine whether or how to proceed with the litigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  For example, the SEC previously issued an Investor Alert about the potential for an investor to invest in an investment in a real estate development project that was not fully funded by the investment.  Among other things, the complaint alleges that, in January 2017, President Donald Trump signed the January EO, which temporarily suspended entry into the country by Iraqis and other non-Iraqi nationals, without providing any basis for the investor to apply for a visa, admission, or other immigration benefit.
