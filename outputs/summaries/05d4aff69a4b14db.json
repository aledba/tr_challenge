  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment against Garden Homes Management Corporation and Garden Homes Residential, L.P., denying Garden Homes' application to build a ninety-five unit apartment building in Fairfield, Connecticut.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, on May 24, 2014, Garden Homes filed an emergency application for a permit to construct a one-way access way to the site of a proposed apartment building. The complaint alleges that the Commission improperly declined to consider the Commission's concerns as to the adequacy of the twenty foot access way width, the number of available fire trucks, and the need for affordable housing.  The complaint further alleges that Garden Homes failed to adequately consider the safety concerns raised by the Commission in its initial and revised site plans.  In its final judgment, the court found that the commission exceeded its burden under Section 8-30 of the federal securities laws by failing to consider those concerns.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Commission consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Garden Homes from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties. The Commission also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount of restitution it has already paid to Garden Homes and to a $100,000 civil penalty from the Commission. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation was conducted by David Spear and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Spear and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kersteeg of the Connecticut Office of Planning and Zoning.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Connecticut Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Fairfield Police Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Office of Emergency Management and the Connecticut Division of Police's Office of Inspector General."
