  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arizona today entered a final judgment in favor of Michael Gary, a defendant in a civil action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Phoenix, Arizona, alleges that, from at least November 2018 through January 2019, Defendant Michael Gary prepared and prepared a motion for an attorney's fee for work related to a pending litigation action against Defendant Sala, Inc.  According to the complaint, Gary failed to comply with the requirements of the federal securities laws, and failed to file a timely and reasonable response to his request for an award of attorneys' fees.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Gary did not adequately disclose to counsel that he was not entitled to a reasonable award of attorney's fees, despite having been named as such by the court as a party to the litigation.  As a result, the SEC's final judgment, which permanently enjoins Defendant Gary from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, orders Defendant Gary to pay $13,167.67 in fees and $1,072.90 in administrative fees, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $6,500. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Defendant Gary consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains the amount of attorney fees he has already paid to the parties in the civil action. The final judgment also orders Plaintiff to pay disgorgement of $11,490.64, plus prejudgment interest of $4,492.33, and to pay civil penalties of $5,000.00 and $9,555.00, respectively, for the work performed by Defendant Gary in preparing the motion for the fees and costs of the litigation action.  On January 16, 2019, the court granted a temporary restraining order against Defendant Gary and ordered him to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest. The court granted the restraining order on January 24, 2019.  Following the court's order, Defendants agreed to a settlement where they will be permanently enjoined from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 13(a)(1) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (c) thereunder. Defendants also agreed to be barred from serving as officers or directors of any SEC-registered public company. The settlements are subject to Court approval."
