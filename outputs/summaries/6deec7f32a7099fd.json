  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Oklahoma today announced criminal charges against Brent Galbreath, a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on February 2, 2005, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Texas, the government alleged that Mr.Galbreath had three prior felony convictions for second-degree burglary and maiming.  The complaint also alleged that, in 2005, when he was sentenced to prison for a third-degree felony, he was convicted of a felony that was not classified as a violent felony by the federal government as a \"crime of violence.\"  The SEC alleges that, as a result of his conviction, he is presently ineligible for a sentence reduction because he was previously sentenced under the federal criminal laws, including the mandatory minimum of five years.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney\u2019s Office for New York today announced that it filed a criminal complaint against Mr. Galreath, alleging that he was a repeat offender, and that he had violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Galbreat consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product or service.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Oklahoma State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
