  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against the Ohio Department of Education and its chair in a related administrative proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Cleveland, Ohio, alleges that, in 2012, the Ohio Secretary of State's Office (\"Secretary of State\") issued an order requiring school district officials to provide an adequate hearing to teachers who did not have their contracts renewed at the end of the 2013-2014 school year.  According to the complaint, the order required the school district to provide a hearing to determine whether a teacher should not be re-employed under the collective-bargaining agreement.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the school board did not provide a sufficient hearing for the teachers to present their case.  As a result, the teachers were not permitted to question the board during the hearing.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the district to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 103069, 2015-Ohio-5431, July 17, 2015. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
