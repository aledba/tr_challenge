  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the State Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") in a civil injunctive action brought by two former registered sex offenders.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that the State DOJ violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that State agents violated the registration provisions of Sections 815.2 and 821.6 of the federal securities laws, and that the DoJ violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (d) of Section 9(a)(1) and 5(b)(3) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to register as a sex offender and by disseminating his information to the public. The defendants also allege that, in 2014, State agents arrested John and issued him a cease-and-desist order, freezing his assets, and ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty. The DoJ's complaint charges the State with violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar against the defendants. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, which is subject to court approval. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Health and Human Services, the San Diego Police Department, and the California Attorney General's Office.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221. The Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of online solicitation of investments in the securities industry.  In a related matter, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in California, charging John and Jane Doe with violations of Section 815 and 815 of the securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of federal law and orders them to pay civil penalties of up to $2.5 million. The judgments also order John to comply with the requirements of Section 10"
