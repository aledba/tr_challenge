  "summary": "On October 24, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a final judgment against April Schroeder, \"Appellant,\" for her role in an alleged sexual assault that occurred in the Mayerson Center at Children's Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, Schroeder was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC alleges that Schroeder consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Schroeder.  Schroeder has agreed to settle the charges against her by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On October 26, 2019, the court entered a judgment against her against her, ordering her to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions, and imposing a five-year conduct-based injunction against her from participating in any future conduct-related proceedings.   The court's order also ordered Schroeder to pay a $75,000 civil penalty. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott A. Thompson and Kelly L. Gibson of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, with assistance from John Rymas of the Ohio Division of Criminal Justice. The litigation will be led by Mr. Thompson, Ms. Gibson, and Mr. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Attorney General's Office, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
