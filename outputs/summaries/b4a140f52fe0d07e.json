  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against a Kansas man and his Kansas accomplice in a multi-jurisdictional criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, Kansas, alleges that, on July 28, 2015, Morgan L. Boeschling and Cody Osborn stole a pickup truck from a Yoder, Kansas restaurant. The complaint alleges that the defendant, who had been charged with felony burglary and felony theft, entered the truck with the intent to steal the pickup. The SEC alleges that Boesschling and Osborn entered the building by themselves, broke into the safe, and stole the pickup from the mechanic's shop next door. According to the complaint, the defendant did not enter the truck while he stole the truck, but rather followed the instructions he had recited at the opening of the jury instructions and entered an accomplice instruction. The court's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,038,767, and a civil penalty of $100,000. The jury deliberated for about 45 minutes before concluding its verdict. The final judgment also orders the defendant to comply with the court's order and consent to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty, and imposing a $20,000 penalty. The judge also agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Boeschingling. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, John Rymas, and Amy C. Welshhans of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Wyshynski."
