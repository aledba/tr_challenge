  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a California-based trustee for residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) fraud.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, in connection with RMBS fraud, Deutsche Bank National Trust Company (DB Structured Prods.) and its trustee, Nomura Credit & Capital, Inc. (N.Y.C.P.&rsquo;), failed to apply a multi-factor analysis to determine the place of injury for purposes of CPLR 202.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that DB Structured, which is the trustee for the RMBS trust, failed to comply with the plaintiff-residence rule, which requires the plaintiff to reside in a representative capacity.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  In addition, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against the trustee, and ordered the trustee to pay a civil penalty of $250,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
