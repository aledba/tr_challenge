  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment against Scott Heagney in a civil injunctive action brought by the city of Fitchburg, Massachusetts.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, alleges that, in October 2013, he submitted an application for the position of Police Chief of Massachusetts. The complaint alleges that heagney was not forthcoming about his work experience or about a court case that had been filed against him when he was 21, and that he had not disclosed to the city prior to his decision not to nominate him as a police chief because of his failure to disclose the criminal case against him.  According to the complaint, the complaint also alleges that the city did not consider the fact that the complaint was false because the complaint had not been filed with the court.  In a parallel action, on March 10, 2014, a federal district court in Massachusetts granted the city's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the city to pay a civil penalty of $750,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the city consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement of $250,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil monetary penalty of a total of $2,500. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On March 24, 2019, the Honorable Rebecca M. Welshhans of the Massachusetts Court of Appeals entered a judgment against Shelly L. Gibson, Jr. of the Boston Regional Office, ordering a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering the district court to determine whether to impose a civil injunction against the defendants, and ordering a hearing on the matter. The court's order also ordered the district attorney's office to conduct an internal investigation into the conduct of the officers involved in the alleged misconduct. The investigation was conducted by Michael J. Haddad and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office, and the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
