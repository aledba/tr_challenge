  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against defendant Ronald D. Morley in a securities fraud case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, alleges that Morley violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Morley agreed to pay restitution in the amount of $270,000, which he claimed constituted a substantial and compelling reason to depart from the securities and investment advisory business in Kansas.  Morley also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay disgorgement of $845,900, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's final judgment, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws, impose pre-judgment interest, and impose a conduct-based penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Morley.  On March 23, 2018, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Morley to surrender his passport and other documents related to the alleged securities fraud.  As part of the settlement, which is subject to court approval, the SEC will determine the appropriate amount of restitution to be paid to the victims.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-12a508(a)(5).  In its continuing investigation, the Kansas Attorney General's Office has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0the subject matter\u00c2\u00a0of\u00c2\u00a0compliance with the\u00c2\u00a0Adviser Rules of Practice\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0Securities Act\u00c2\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00c2\u00a010(b)(2)\u00c2\u00a02014.\u00c2\u00a0On\u00c2\u00a0January\u00c2\u00a017, 2020, the Office of Inspector General\u00c2\u00a0has issued an Investor Alert about\u00c2\u00a0Violations of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule\u00c2\u00a012a-13 thereunder,\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0require investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background and\u00c2\u00a0perform\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0before\u00c2\u00a0announcing\u00c2\u00a0their\u00c2\u00a0adviser\u00c2\u00a0statutory\u00c2\u00a0statement of\u00c2\u00a0defend"
