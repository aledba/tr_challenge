  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against HJC Corp., a South Korean manufacturer of motorcycle helmets, for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that HJC, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, J&P Cycles, LLC, sold a 2009 model Z1R Nomad Sinister half-shell motorcycle helmet to a Florida-based distributor, who then placed it in a tire tube and sold it in Florida.  According to the complaint, the alleged design defect is a \"but-for\" cause of the alleged defect and is a foreseeable consequence of manufacturing a defective safety product.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in 2013, HJC sold the helmet to another company, who took title to the helmet in Korea.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants failed to adequately disclose to the court that they were not liable for the alleged defects in the product, and that they had no duty to detect or detect the defects.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the complaint and in its order to dismiss the case, the court entered a temporary restraining order, which prohibits HJC from further violating the anti-fraud provision of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders HJC to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  On January 6, 2020, the SEC filed an amended complaint, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  It also filed a complaint seeking a preliminary injunction, an accounting of HJC's sales of the helmets, and a court order prohibiting the defendants from associating with any foreign company that sells or sells a product in the United States.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2019 (Feb. 18, 2019).  The U.K. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.
