  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Robert Fool Bear, Sr., a Wyoming man charged with aggravated sexual abuse of a child.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, charges Fool Bear with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Wyoming today announced criminal charges against Fool Bear.  According to the complaint, on three separate occasions, Fool Bear allegedly engaged in penile penetration with his niece.  As alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, this conduct occurred during a period of time when the niece was not home from school because she was sick and Fool Bear was the only other person home.  Fool Bear also allegedly used force to restrain or injure his niece, and the complaint alleges that the niece, a month prior to discovery of child pornography in his possession, had engaged in a sexual act with him that lasted \u201conce or twice every month.\u201d  The complaint further alleges that Fool Bear did not consent to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to a judgment that permanently restrains and injunctive relief, including a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from associating with any third party, including an attorney, from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of a public company, from purchasing or selling a security deposit, from making any investment in a company, and from engaging in any form of sexual activity with a person under the age of 12.  Additionally, the judgment orders Fool Bear to pay $1.5 million in restitution, which is equal to the amount of restitution that he has already paid to the victims of the alleged crime.  On the other hand, the SEC alleges that neither Fool Bear nor his niece engaged in any conduct that constitutes a substantial step toward the commission of a serious criminal offense, and that neither of these actions constituted a sufficient step to justify the imposition of a civil injunction against further violations of the charged provision.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221.   \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Eric R. Werner and supervised by Jennifer C. McKinley of the Chicago Regional Office."
