  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found incompetent to stand trial for the murders of his wife and mother-in-law.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Fort Worth, Texas, alleges that Robert M. Appellant entered the home of his in-laws and killed his wife, Keitha Turner, and his mother, Betty Jo Frank, by cutting their throats.  According to the complaint, the defendants' statements to the court were consistent over the course of several months, and they were consistent from the outset of the trial.  As alleged in the complaint:    The defendants were not cooperative with the prosecution, and the trial court refused to hold a hearing on the merits of the case.  Appellants' attorney, Patrick McCann, agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Texas today announced criminal charges against Appelland.   In its continuing investigation, the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments in an investment in a real estate development project.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's Investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by David Axelrod and Karen Gollaher, and supervised by Chedly C.
