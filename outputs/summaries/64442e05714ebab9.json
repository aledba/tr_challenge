  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against Carlos Walter Argueta, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 15 years in prison for a series of criminal acts.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that, on June 5, 2015, the District Court entered an order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering the entry of a new trial order.  According to the complaint, the court entered the order without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.    The complaint alleges that the defendant entered the apartment after he was warned that he had trespassed and had to be restrained by a security guard.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant. \u00c2\u00a0Argueta has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and officer-and-director bars.\u00c2\u00a0The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 24, 2019).  The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa, Chief of the Salt Lake Regional Office, and Joseph G. Sansone, Regional Director of the Utah Division of Criminal Investigation.  Senior Trial Counsel for the U. S. Attorney\u2019s Office for New York and the Division of Justice will lead the litigation under the supervision of Assistant Regional Director Eric R. Kasper. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Utah Department of Justice, and the Utah Office of Criminal Investigations in this matter."
