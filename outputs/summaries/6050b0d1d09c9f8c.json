  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment against UBS Financial Services, Inc. (\"UBS\"), a New York-based registered investment adviser, for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that UBS failed to timely distribute funds to a beneficiary of three individual retirement accounts owned by Patrick Kenney, his former romantic partner, and held by Margaret Kenney.  The complaint alleges that, after Kenney died, UBS delayed distributing the funds to the beneficiary, Aliberti's son, and Kenney's niece as contingent beneficiaries.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the UBS agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  UBS also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against U.K.-based broker-dealer Blue Mountain Wallcoverings, Inc., based on the same conduct alleged in the SEC's amended complaint.  On May 2, 2016, the court entered a judgment ordering UBS to disgorge its ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay an officer and director bar in the amount of $100,000.  According to the court's order, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (March 10, 2018).  The case was supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Asset Management Unit, under the supervision of John Rymas of the Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA) in the New York Office of Financial Regulation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)."
