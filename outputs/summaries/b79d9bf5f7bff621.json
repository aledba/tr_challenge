  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against International Paper Company, Inc., a Louisiana-based company that manufactures and sells paper products.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on June 17, 2016, James H. Evans, Jr., of Campti, Louisiana, began to experience pain in his left leg while performing preventive maintenance tasks in the paper machine number 2 area of the plant. According to the complaint, Mr. Evans immediately sought treatment with an orthopedic surgeon, who diagnosed him with a stress fracture or stress reaction and recommended that he remove an intermedullary nail and screws to alleviate the pain. The complaint also alleges that he did not complete an accident or incident report until shortly before the expiration of his company's workers' compensation benefits.  In its judgment, the court found that the company violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the company consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay $3,000.00 in disgorgement, $1,097.69 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty and attorney fees. The court also granted the company's request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order against future violations of the anti-fraud provisions.  On May 24, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Evans, charging him with violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1, and with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar against Evans.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael Acurio, a partner of the Public Finance Abuse Unit's Director of Investor Education and Advocacy, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Ms. Wimbiscus. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Louisiana Department of Insurance, and the Louisiana Office of Inspector General."
