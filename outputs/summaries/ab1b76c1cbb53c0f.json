  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada today entered a final judgment against Thomas J. Knickmeyer, Jr., a former bailiff employed by the Nevada Department of Justice (EJDC) for misconduct in connection with his employment with the EJDC. According to the court's order, Knickmeek violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by improperly disclosing and relying upon his prior disciplinary history as justification for his termination. The court also found that, contrary to the SEC's findings, he was not provided with discovery relating to three prior disciplinary incidents (from 1997, 2003, and 2013) that were used against him during the arbitration, in violation of the requirements of NRS 289.040, 289.057, and 289.060. As an additional finding, the court found that the defendants acted within the scope of their powers by failing to determine whether or not the arbitrator was reasonable in deciding to terminate them. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action and obtained an emergency court order halting the proceedings. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Las Vegas, charges Knickmieek with violations of the anti-fraud provision of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The case is being handled by John G. Roberts, Jr. and James Madison, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Nevada Secretary of State's Office, the U. S. Attorney's Secret Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Nevada Commodities Futures Trading Commission.  For further information, see Press Release No. 543, 547, 96 P.3d 1155, 1271. The Commission's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by John R.
