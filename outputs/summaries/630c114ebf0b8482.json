  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment in favor of a Texas man who was found guilty of a felony family violence charge.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, alleges that Alfred T. Moliere violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Moliere was charged by a trial court with violating the pre-judgment provision of Section 102.013 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which requires the trial court to determine whether a defendant has a legitimate criminal defense purpose. The court found that the defendants were in a relationship and had two children, and that the defendant had a right to a jury trial.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Moliere.  Moliere has agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement, which is subject to court approval, reserves the issue of whether to proceed with a civil injunctive action. The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice in this matter. The case is being handled by Scott A. Williams, Eric R. Kasper, and Jan Folena of the Dallas Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Messrs. Williams and Folena."
