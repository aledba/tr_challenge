  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a convicted sex offender who was sentenced to 72 months of supervised release.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in New York on May 24, 2016, Michael J. Appellant, a convicted felon, was ordered to participate in a sex offender specific assessment and participation in a treatment program based on his prior convictions for a sex-offense related condition. The court found that the assessment and treatment conditions violated the federal antifraud provisions of Section 3553(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and imposed the condition based on the defendant\u2019s prior criminal history.  The court also found that, in imposing the treatment condition, the defendant was not a danger to the community because he had not committed a sex offense since 1995, he already underwent a psychiatric evaluation in 2000, and he committed no violations during his pretrial release, and therefore the condition was not unreasonable.  In its judgment, the court also imposed a three-level downward departure from the mandatory minimum of 72 months in which he would have been sentenced.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the judgment, however, the Court held that the defendants had violated the statutory provisions of the federal sentencing laws, and that the court had failed to adequately consider the mitigating factors that led to the imposition of the condition, such as the nature and circumstances of the defendant's prior convictions and conduct that is consistent with the policies of the sentencing court.  It also ruled that the defendant had a history of mental illness and substance abuse and that he had been convicted of multiple felony charges.  As a result of this finding, the defendants will be barred from participating in the supervised release program, and the court will determine whether to impose a penalty based upon the severity of the offender's prior felony convictions.  On May 26, 2017, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Office of Inspector General issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Release Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage people to check the backgrounds of people committing or committing a serious felony by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0institut\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0investigations.gov website to identify people who are at risk of committing or participating in a serious criminal offense.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Institutional Education and Advocacy has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint\u00c2\u00a0On June 13, 2018, the SEC filed a Complaint in the United States District Court in Manhattan alleging that the District Court improperly imposed a mandatory 12-month downward release without providing any reasonable explanation.
