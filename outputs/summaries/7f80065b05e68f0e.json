  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against a Kansas man who was charged with using deadly force in defense of three women at the top of the stairs in his apartment building.  According to the SEC's complaint, on April 30, 2016, Seth Collins, a 38-year-old white man who lives in a second-floor apartment building in Kansas City, Missouri, was confronted by three identical twin daughters who demanded that he use deadly force to prevent great bodily harm to himself.  The complaint alleges that Collins raised the issue of whether he was entitled to self-defense immunity when, in fact, he was not entitled to such immunity because he was an aggressor and did not believe deadly force was necessary to protect himself from imminent harm.  As alleged in the complaint, Collins' actions were so aggressive and aggressive that he almost fell down the stairs, causing one of the twin daughters to hit her head and mouth with the knife.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Missouri today announced criminal charges against Collins.  On May 31, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Collins, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Scott A. Thompson. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kansas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Department of Justice in this matter."
