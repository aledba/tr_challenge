  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the District of Columbia's motion for summary judgment in a related criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that, on December 28, 2002, a Pennsylvania officer initiated a traffic stop and arrested Holloway for driving under the influence of alcohol. According to the complaint, Holloway was subsequently arrested for a second DUI and was subsequently sentenced to five years' imprisonment. The complaint further alleges that Holloway successfully completed Pennsylvania's Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition program and was able to participate in a work release program when he was arrested for the second DUI. The SEC alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 922(g)(1) of the federal securities laws. The court's order against Holloway, who was previously barred from possessing a firearm, requires him to show a substantial, not perfect, fit between the severity of his second DUI offense and its compelling interest in preventing armed mayhem. Without discounting the significance of Holloway's second DUI conviction, the court also found that he had a history of reckless driving and that he should not have been barred from purchasing a firearm. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against him.  In its continuing investigation, the SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them a gun.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Thomas E. Binderup and supervised by Scott A. Thompson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Thompson and Ms. Thompson. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Criminal Justice. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Pennsylvania Department of Justice, and the Pennsylvania State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
