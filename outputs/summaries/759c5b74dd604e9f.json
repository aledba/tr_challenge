  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for failing to provide timely and accurate information about Haiti's progress in recovering from a 2010 earthquake.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Secretary of State Kelly made a false and misleading statement in her January 2017 announcement regarding Haiti's status for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haiti.  According to the complaint, Secretary Kelly's order to extend TPS for Haiti for six months was based on information that Haiti was recovering from the 2010 earthquake and had substantially improved since 2010.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, Kelly has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering her to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order suspending the suspension of the TPS suspension pending an investigation by the Office of the United States Attorney's Assistant Secretary for the Northern District of California.  On May 24, 2017, the Departmentof Homeland Security issued an alert about the deteriorating condition of Haiti's TPS program, which it described as a \"long-standing, intractable problem\" that required the return of Haitian nationals from the country who had been internally displaced by the 2010 quake.  Among other things, the complaint alleges that Kelly failed to adequately assess the country conditions that led to Haiti's designation for TPS.  Kelly also failed to inform her staff about the need for additional information about Haitian nationals to be prepared to respond to the Commission's recommendations.  As a result, the Commission issued a temporary restraining order and issued a cease-and-desist order, freezing the assets of the Commission and ordering the Commission to conduct an internal review of the matter.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Kelly and supervised by Marc Blau of the New York Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Haitian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Haitian Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
